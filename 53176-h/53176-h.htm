<div><h1 class='nobreak'>AUTHOR’S NOTE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I have always regarded the writing of prefaces to
be, for the most part, work thrown away; nevertheless,
I am tempted to prefix a few words to this novel,
in the form of a note, in order to defend myself
against charges which may possibly be made against
me by the critics, and to which I may be unable to
revert after they shall have been preferred. It may
be said, in the first place, that all the characters in
this story speak ordinary English, which I admit.
The natural language of the natives is, of course, the
tongue of their race, Chipewyan or Eskimo, as the
case may be, but in order that the reader might
understand it, a translation was necessary. Since
this was the case, why not have the translation in
good English, instead of in pigeon-English, which no
one properly understands and which is misleading
and equally untrue to life? Then, again, my description
of Chesterfield Inlet may be found fault with,
and with good reason, for I have written of trees
where no trees exist. Chesterfield Inlet is in the
barren lands, as most people know. But a wooded
district was necessary to my plot, and in describing
the country I have changed the topography to suit
the requirements of my story. And now, as a last
word, I would assure my readers that the incidents
in this novel, though they may appear untrue to life
and far-fetched, are nevertheless mostly made up of
my own personal experiences and properly authenticated
stories of curious happenings to other people in
these northern regions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bright, bitter-cold day in the short
days of winter. The sun shone forlornly upon the
bleak, ice-bound shores of Hudson Bay, as if in
despair at its utter inability to warm the intensely
cold atmosphere, or change in the slightest degree
the frozen face of nature. Limitless fields of dazzling
Whiteness stretched to the horizon on either
hand; a tremendous expanse of turbulent ice-fields,
of hills and ridges, of plains and dells; a great white
world, apparently empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over all was the silence of death; a silence of awful
profundity, yet at the same time an indescribably
beautiful revelation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near at hand a trapped Arctic fox lay dishevelled
and bleeding, its little green eyes glittering evilly
and watching with some apprehension the movements
of an object which had sprung up, apparently from
nowhere, to advance upon it with startling directness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object was Roy Thursby, an intrepid young
officer of the Hudson’s Bay Company, visiting his
“line” of traps; a big fellow of five-and-twenty,
with muscles of iron; a clean-shaven face—a noble
face that betrayed a high-minded nature; eyes that
as a rule were hard, but could soften; and a heart
that never quailed. He was dressed in moleskin
trousers, a pair of long blue stroud leggings, a coat
made of hairy-deerskin (that is to say, deerskin
dressed on the one side only), with a hood edged with
fur, a l’Assumption belt that encircled his waist, and
large deerskin moccasins, under which he undoubtedly
wore at least two pairs of hairy-deerskin socks.
Mittens of dressed deerskin were suspended from his
shoulders by a worsted cord, and a fur cap with earpieces
completed his costume. He wore snowshoes
and carried a hunting-bag across his back and a rifle
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the undulating plain he came, pausing occasionally,
diverging rarely, and ever nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length there was the sound of crunching snow,
the swish of snowshoes; a short, stifled bark, and a
white, furry, inanimate thing lay on the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without doffing his mitts Roy reset the trap. It
was a steel trap, destitute of teeth, with two springs.
The jaws when spread out flat were exactly on a level
with the snow. He hid the chain and brushed a thin
layer of snow on top of the trap. A few scraps of
fish were scattered about for bait and the whole carefully
smoothed over, so that it was almost impossible
to tell that anything was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he straightened himself. The air had
needles in it, and he readjusted the hood of his hairy
coat and tightened the wide ribbed belt around his
waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slipping the fox into his bag, he reached for his
axe and gun, and with the long, even strides of one
who could never tire, continued his “rounds,” pausing
now and then to “trim” a trap when nothing
was in it, or killing an animal when caught and
dropping it into his trapping-bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he pressed on, his keen eyes, ever alert, caught
a glimpse of a small dark blot moving along the face
of a ridge of rocks in the foreground. He paused
in his stride to scrutinize the moving object; then,
apparently satisfied, he resumed his tramp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yowl, yowl; kum-pack, kum-pack—ptarmigan ran
uneasily together in an adjacent clump of willows.
Whir-r-r, and a flock flew up at his very feet. Other
flocks followed on the right and left of him, but he
heeded them not, for his thoughts were on the
“packet.” Somewhere in the wilderness of snow
and ice to the south, two men and a train of dogs
were laboring and straining every nerve to reach
Fort Future. Of this the Company’s hard and fast
regulations made him cognizant: but where were
they? Already they were several days overdue.
What could have happened to detain them? Would
they reach the Fort that day? These and like questions
occupied his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon he was winding his way up a gully in the
ridge of rocks, and right before him was the object
he had previously descried. As he drew near, it
took on the form of an Indian girl, a young and
beautiful Chipewyan of about eighteen summers.
She wore a blanket-skirt, very short as to length; a
pair of red stroud leggings, beadwork moccasins and
a thick woollen shawl, which ordinarily muffled the
head and face but had now slipped back, leaving
them exposed to view. She was a Chipewyan, but
had scarcely a feature like them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face was exquisitely moulded, and of a rich
golden brown; her cheeks of coral red; her eyes
large, dark and liquid, very strongly marked brows
and long, thick lashes; her mouth was small and
expressive, with very beautiful teeth. Her hair was
neatly braided, crossed at the back of the head and
tied on either side with a piece of narrow ribbon.
She turned as he approached, and, dropping a bundle
of short sticks and an axe, stood with heightened
color and a pretty, embarrassed look on her finely
cut features, waiting for him to come up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With eyes intent upon the trader, the girl was
quite oblivious of the presence of the middle-aged
man of unprepossessing appearance, who had been
skulking behind her for some time. Perceiving her
preoccupation, he now approached her with a stealthy
tread. In a flash he leaped from the background and
caught her in his arms, drew her to him with a force
she could not resist, and kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to repeat this, when she gaspingly
cried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an answering shout, the sound of someone
running, a voice that imparted courage, crying,
“I am here, Kasba!” and suddenly she was wrested
from the man’s clutches and he was sent violently to
the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Palpitating with fear, the girl crouched down,
hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy stood breathing sharply, waiting for the man
to rise. “By heaven, Broom,” he thundered, in a
wrath that was terrible, “this is too much! I will
not stand this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom picked himself up. Instinctively his hand
felt for his revolver; he evidently had no scruples
against attacking an unarmed man (when Roy
rushed to Kasba’s assistance he had dropped his gun
and it lay some few yards away), and inwardly he
cursed himself for not having the weapon upon his
person. “Curse you,” he cried hoarsely, a paroxysm
of rage almost preventing the utterance. “I’ll kill
you for that!” and, roaring like a wild beast, he
hurled himself upon his opponent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other’s blazing eyes narrowed ominously. He
met Broom’s mad rush with a swing of his heavy
arm. The impact resounded sharply, and there was
considerable force behind the blow, for the brute
staggered and again fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recovering himself, he stood sucking his bleeding
lips, and glaring venomously at his antagonist.
“<span class='it'>You</span> won’t stand this!” he shouted with a blast of
profanity; “and who are <span class='it'>you</span>?” Then with an insolent
laugh: “Oh, I see now how ’tis, I was poaching
on your preserves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader made a quick step toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But defiantly the fellow went on: “Of course if
I’d known how matters stood between you and this
little——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” roared Roy, rushing upon him.
“Silence! Speak another word and I will kill you!
By heaven, I will! I will kill you where you stand!”
His eyes fixed upon the other’s blazing orbs and held
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom was no coward, but there was such fierce
wrath in the trader’s look that it caused him to hesitate,
and in that moment of hesitation he remembered
what he had lost all thought of in his baffled
fury—remembered that Roy was all-powerful in
those parts, where he held the food supply and controlled
the natives; that the trader could turn him
adrift in the trackless wilderness to meet a certain
death. And in another moment he had recovered
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed awkwardly. “I beg pardon,” he said
with a sneer; “I will leave you with the—lady.”
Then, bowing mockingly to Kasba, who was now on
her feet, he left them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the fellow had gone, Roy went up to the
girl, and taking one of her hands softly in both his,
began to comfort her. She was breathing heavily
and her face was pale. “Oh, I am so terrified!” she
said; “I know he will do you harm. He will kill
you! Heaven! It would be terrible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t be the first time it was tried,” Roy
answered with an easy laugh. “Don’t worry, little
friend,” he added, patting her hand tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wave of color flooded the girl’s face. “Oh, you
are so strong, and so brave,” she cried, then stopped,
lost in admiration. She stood looking at him now out
of half-closed eyes. Her lashes were long, and
shadowed the orbs so that he could not see the expression
in them. Then she smiled dazzlingly and
turned her face aside, but one full blushing cheek
was kept towards him and one shell-like little ear—I
am afraid this heroine of ours was a natural little
coquette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy started a little and tried to scrutinize the
girl’s face more closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba’s breath came quickly, her heart palpitated
wildly, the crimson deepened in her cheeks and brow.
Her secret was there—plain for him to read, and he
would have been blind, indeed, had he not read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprised, and somewhat startled, he dropped her
hand and stepped back, looking at her uncertainly
for a moment. Then Kasba laughed, a nervous little
laugh, and tossing her head back, and opening her
eyes wide, looked at him roguishly,—brown as a
berry but a veritable little beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments there was silence, then Roy
turned and walked away. A profound pity was in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl’s flashed and she stamped her little
foot furiously. Her teeth set tightly, her breath
coming and going swiftly. Then tears trembled in
her eyes, and in an irresistible impulse of yearning
she threw out her arms and softly called his name.
But he did not pause or look back, and she dropped
her arms and bent her head with a sigh of pain. She
was a little bundle of opposites, this dusky maiden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto she had roamed the country unattended
and unmolested, pure, happy, serene. Now at one
blow all this was changed. Broom’s assault on her
had opened her eyes to the danger of wandering
alone. Her violent struggles to free herself from his
tight embrace had bruised her arms and bosom, and
she ached in every limb. But her agony of body
was as nothing compared with her agony of mind.
Ignorant of the world, she knew nothing of the
prejudices of rank or race, but Roy’s walking away
had somehow revealed their relative positions; and
Kasba considered it folly to think anything good
could possibly come from her unwise affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time she stooped down, and, lifting up the
bundle of sticks, threw it across her back, then moved
away. Erect and supple, gently swaying under her
burden, she glided along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crossing a small pond in a deep hollow in the
summit of the rocks, she came in sight of her father’s
hut, which stood quite alone, at some little distance
from the Fort, in the sheltering angle of a ridge of
rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie, her father, was a widower, and as Kasba
was his only child he showered all the love of his
poor old heart upon her. Nothing was too good for
her, no sacrifice too great. She had been brought up
at Churchill, and though he still clung to many of the
superstitions of his race, he had allowed her to attend
the day school conducted by the missionary, and in
the end to spend most of her childhood at the Mission,
for the missionary’s wife had soon become fond of
the bright little motherless girl, and had easily persuaded
the doting old man that it was to the girl’s
advantage. So it had come about that it was to this
good lady Kasba owed her superior manners and
refinement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba had been exceedingly happy in those days.
But since she had come with her father to Fort
Future a deep shadow had come into her young life.
She had offered Roy Thursby all the love of her
warm little heart and he had turned from it. She
was intensely miserable. In her present misery she
thought of those cloudless days, and a sigh escaped
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sad, Kasba,” said a voice in Chipewyan
at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stopped and looked up. It was Sahanderry,
a tall, active-looking native.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba turned to him with a wan smile. She was
fond of Sahanderry, for she had known him all her
life; besides, he wished to marry her. Remembering
how quickly Roy had turned away on discovering
her secret love for him, a feeling of tenderness came
over her for this Indian. “Should she spoil his
life?” she asked herself. “What had she to do with
love? The girls of her race,” she argued, “had no
voice in the choosing of their husbands.” For the
first time in her life she felt discontented with her
lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it, Sahanderry,” she said, a trifle bitterly,
as he reached up to take the bundle from her back.
“It’s contrary to the customs of our race for men to
carry wood; that’s woman’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry looked at her a moment in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are not like the other women of our
race,” he urged, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still I am a Chipewyan,” she burst forth. Then
seeing the pained, puzzled expression on his face,
she put out her hand tenderly and touched him on
the arm. “Forgive me,” she said, “I am sorry. I
did not mean to be unkind. What I meant to say
was that I’m a Chipewyan and must follow the customs
of my people.” With this she walked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stood bewildered. He could not understand
Kasba in her present mood. He had often met
her in this way and she had never before objected
to his taking her burden. He felt she was behaving
unfairly. He watched her for a moment, then, like
a faithful dog, slowly followed after. He had not
gone far, however, before he saw her stop and look
round. At this, he quickened his footsteps, caught
up with her and walked close behind her, for the rest
of the way in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arriving at the hut, the girl dropped her load and
entered, and instantly attended to the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hut was built of logs, caulked with moss, and
had a flat roof. It comprised only one room. In the
centre of this was a large Carron stove, the pipes
from which completely encircled the room before
bolting out of a hole in the roof to carry off the
smoke. The walls were bare of paint and ornamented
with snowshoes, dog-whips, shotbags and such other
paraphernalia of the chase. A few rude shelves held
such articles as a clock and a lamp, while the table
was of rough plank, and a few empty cases did duty
for chairs. Pushed against the rear wall and opposite
the door were two narrow beds, neatly covered
with deerskin robes. High overhead several long
sticks or poles had been suspended horizontally to
form a rack or shelf, on the theory that heat rises,
and half-a-dozen fish lay there slowly thawing out,
while several pairs of moccasins, in various stages
of dryness, dangled from it by their strings. The
place, though primitive, was clean and tidy, and bore
unmistakable signs of a woman’s careful attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry brought in an armful of wood, which
he dropped beside the stove. Kasba reached out her
hand blindly, placed a few of the pieces gingerly
upon the embers and blew the whole into a blaze;
then, satisfied that the fire was well under way, she
rose from her knees, and putting off her outdoor
clothing, selected half-a-dozen ptarmigan from a
number on the table, and, seating herself on an empty
sugar-case, commenced to pluck the birds into a large
tin bowl at her feet. She worked the faster because
a dull pain was making itself felt in her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence. Presently the man fumbled in
his pocket and brought forth a knife and a plug of
nigger-head, which he proceeded to cut up on a
corner of the table. He glanced at the girl slyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noise of the tobacco-cutting and the crackling
of the fire were the only sounds to break the stillness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having duly and solemnly finished the operation,
Sahanderry took out his pipe, which he leisurely
filled. Presently there was a grunt of satisfaction,
and a cloud of smoke issued from his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl threw him a furtive glance. He happened
to be looking at her at that instant and caught
her in the act. Kasba dropped her head. A wistful
expression came into the man’s face, and laying
aside his pipe, he leaned forward, as if to get a
closer look at her countenance, but she dropped her
head still lower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kasba,” he said earnestly, then stooped over
her, gently tilting her chin upwards so that he could
see her face more closely, “why won’t you promise
to marry me when we get back to Churchill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I am a bad, wicked Indian,” she said
presently with a show of impulse, and tearing herself
free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stood staring at her, thunderstruck.
“<span class='it'>You</span> bad! <span class='it'>You</span> wicked!” he ejaculated, greatly
amazed. Then, suddenly his look of amazement
changed to one of outrage. His brow darkened and
his eyes struck fire. “If <span class='it'>Bekothrie</span> (master)
has——” he began, shaking his fist in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl sprang to her feet and stopped him
with some little excitement. The bird she was
plucking fell from her lap to the feathers in the bowl
and sank out of sight. “Hush, Sahanderry!” she
cried, severely. “Remember, it is of the master
you are speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man fairly hung his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Kasba with all her impetuosity possessed
considerable sense of justice and grasping his arm
tightly, she went on resolutely. “You must not
speak against Mr. Thursby. This trouble is all of
my own making. I alone am to blame. I have been
very silly, and—if you will forgive me and be patient
with me, I—I—” she dropped her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will love me?” he suggested, eagerly, his
face betraying the liveliest emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was silent several moments, then raised her
face, a little paler than it had been, but with a
passionless resolve set on it. “If I can,” she responded
bravely, giving him her hands. “I will
<span class='it'>try</span> to love you, I—” she stopped and his arms went
about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make me very happy!” he said. Then he
kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She closed her eyes to shut out the look on his
face, and pushed him gently from her. “No, no;
not now!” she said, all in a tremble. “Give me time.
Give this evil spell time to pass away, and be good
and patient with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be patient, Kasba,” he said, pressing her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s actions reminded her sharply of how
soothingly another had patted her hand shortly before,
how the other’s touch had caused the blood to
dance in her veins and to rush to her face and her
heart to beat so wildly with joy that it had shown
itself in her eyes; and she withdrew her hand
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” enquired Sahanderry,
feeling the rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” replied the girl a trifle coldly and
drawing back a little. “You had better go now, the
master will be wanting you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man bowed his head mutely, and turned
slowly on his heel. At the door he looked back. She
smiled at him, but there was a great deal of sadness
in the look. He returned the smile and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stood still and watched him go. Then
with her handkerchief she rubbed vigorously at her
cheek—the place where Sahanderry had kissed her.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span><h1>CHAPTER II.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>FORT FUTURE.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Fort Future consisted of a solitary group of
small buildings situated near the mouth of Chesterfield
Inlet, which is in the Barren Lands. It seemed
as if the buildings must have sprung up there of
themselves, like so many mushrooms; or must have
been dropped from the heavens, or else carried there
by one of those raging, tearing windstorms that sweep
over that part of the country, so incongruous did they
appear in that vast northern wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, Fort Future was a comfortable place
in its way—at least so said Roy Thursby; for he,
like most of the Company’s officers, was acquainted
with starvation, solitude and desolation, and knew
there were posts compared with which Fort Future,
with its unfailing supply of country provisions, was a
veritable paradise. Broom called it “a rotten hole,”
“the last place that God Almighty made,” and by
much worse names; all of which Roy would laughingly
refute by telling him that he was a sailor, and
therefore never satisfied; that for himself he had no
objections to banishment; and Broom would retaliate
by asserting that Roy was a Hudson’s Bay man,
that the Company owned him body and soul, and
that he was there because he had been sent—which
was true as to the last part. The Hudson’s Bay
Company had required a fearless and staunch man
to establish a post at Chesterfield Inlet, and after
some correspondence with his chief—Roy was then
second in charge at York Factory—Thursby had
been chosen. His willingness to go, if ever thought
of at all, had been looked upon as a mere matter of
course. The Company’s interests had to be attended
to, therefore go he must, willing or unwilling.
Luckily for him, and perhaps for the Company too,
the enterprise had appealed to the strong spirit of
adventure in the young officer, and he had entered
into the scheme with eagerness and made his arrangements
with all enthusiasm, treating the prospective
dangers with total indifference. The wonderful Far
North breeds men of this stamp: men of courage,
resourcefulness and self-reliance; men who fear
nothing and live hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was more than a year ago, and in the interval
he had established the post and enthroned himself,
so to speak, monarch of all he surveyed. He held
his kingdom and ruled his subjects—wandering
bands of Eskimo, who displayed a curious mixture
of simplicity and fear and a disposition to high-handed
robbery with an indomitable will and daring
courage. The works of some Arctic voyagers describe
the Eskimos as inveterate thieves and of murderous
dispositions, while others speak of them as
honest, good-natured fellows, which is perplexing.
But the fact is, both descriptions are true, even of
people of the same tribe, which proves the Eskimo
character is a difficult problem to solve. At one time
he may be good and amiable, and at another all that
is bad and treacherous. Much depends upon conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides himself, the resident population of Fort
Future consisted of five other human beings, to wit:
the man Broom, Kasba, Delgezie, Sahanderry, and a
boy named David. The last four were Chipewyan
Indians from Churchill. In fact, save these and a
few wandering bands of Eskimo, there was not another
human being to be found within a hundred
miles of this desolate spot in any direction, and then
only a few transient visitors such as came with
American and other whalers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy Thursby was a bachelor, though not indisposed
to change his estate under favorable conditions,
as we shall see; Sahanderry cooked for him and did
the general housework, while Kasba washed and
mended his clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fort stood on an old gravel beach about five
miles from the coast. The inlet or river widened immediately
before it, and miles of ice hummocks extended
where once the restless wave had raised its
angry crest; countless masses thrown up into weird,
fantastic shapes by the peculiar workings of some
mysterious submarine power, their formation was
constantly changing in these strange upheavals. The
establishment consisted of a few one-storey log buildings.
The trading-store, warehouse, and one or two
minor stores were grouped together, while the
“master’s” house stood apart in the background. A
small coast-boat, hauled well above high-water mark,
lay propped up in its winter quarters; a flagstaff
reared its head skywards; and a number of Eskimo
dogs ran about among the buildings or lay curled up
in the snow, their long hairy coats covered with
rime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy Thursby was worried. Broom’s assault on
Kasba foreshadowed trouble, and much of it, in the
future. Also, Roy was greatly annoyed. At first he
was determined to make Broom “hit the track.” His
presence at the Fort would now be a constant menace
to his peace of mind. Therefore the fellow must go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he became calmer, Roy’s better nature
asserted itself. He remembered that terms of familiarity
prevailed among Broom’s late associates, and
he decided, after severely cautioning him, to let the
unpleasant incident drop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom had lived two years among the Eskimos.
A man of a different nature and a higher moral tone
might have improved the natives during this two
years. But the fellow had drifted with the current
of popular custom and had adopted tribal manners
and usages. I do not think he would have ill-treated
a woman; but he looked upon them as being created
solely for the use and pleasure of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, too, Roy was distressed at discovering
Kasba’s secret. The knowledge that Kasba loved
him surprised and pained him beyond measure. For
he was not a vain man. He had always admired the
girl, she was so quiet, and had such pretty, shy little
ways and gestures; but beyond thinking of her as a
pleasant little thing to have about him, he had never
given her a thought. Under the new conditions he
hardly knew what to do. There was a deep tinge of
pity for her in his thoughts. The matter was still
puzzling him when he arrived at the door of his
dwelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dogs greeted him with suppressed growls of
welcome. Jumping up, they sniffed enquiringly at
the bag on his back. With a “Down, Flyer, Mush,
Klondike!” he slipped his feet out of his snowshoe
lines and crossed the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two-roomed house contained a kitchen and
what served as a bed-room and living-room; had only
one door, and very few windows. There was little
of luxury. In the kitchen a large cookstove, on which
several kettles stood simmering and emitting little
clouds of steam, was the chief ornament. A very
serviceable water-barrel stood in one corner, while a
large wood-box occupied another. Pots and pans
hung from nails in the walls and a heavy table of
rough plank occupied a position near the stove. The
floor was of plank and well swept, for Roy was fastidious.
The walls of the other room were white-washed,
the chairs and table all country-made and
unpainted. A large wooden clock ticked solemnly
on the wall, and there were pictures and photographs
tacked up or standing on shelves, with a conglomeration
of other small articles more or less useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy dropped the bag from his shoulders and
emptied its contents on the kitchen floor. There were
three white foxes and a blue one. These he hung up
to thaw. Then he stepped into the inner room and
there pulled off his outdoor clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated in a chair, with his feet resting on the lower
of two bunks which were fitted on one side of the
room, was Broom. He was reading a book with a
paper cover brilliantly illuminated—one of those
“Three-Fingered Jack” series of stories so eagerly
devoured by uncultured minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom shut the book as Roy entered the room.
He nodded familiarly, distorted his swollen lips into
a smile and dropped his feet to the floor. “Well,
what luck?” he inquired with feigned interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three whites and a blue,” replied the trader.
He tried to put some heartiness into his words, but
the irritation he still felt at the man held him back.
He went back to the kitchen to wash his hands, and
Broom returned to his book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pausing in his ablutions, Roy threw the man a
searching glance. He now had a great mistrust of
him. And here I may perhaps best explain who
Broom was, as he is a gentleman with whom we
shall have much concern in these pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom was a runaway sailor. Deserting his ship
at Cape Fullerton, he had one day turned up at Fort
Future. He might be one of those worthless characters
found in all occupations, but he was a white
man, and that had been enough for Roy Thursby.
Besides he had shown considerable courage in
attempting a solitary journey down the coast to the
Fort. This appealed to Roy and he had allowed him
to stay on, intending to give him a passage in the
coast-boat that went south in the spring. At first the
runaway had been very energetic. He had made
himself useful about the place and regularly attended
the few traps he had put down, as he laughingly remarked,
to keep himself in tobacco, but latterly he
had slackened off and appeared discontented. He
displayed fits of irritability and moodiness. Roy
had noticed this, and after Broom’s late outbreak he
seriously doubted his wisdom in having harbored
him. Debating the question, he went back to the
inner room and sat down; then in very plain language
told the sailor what he thought of his conduct.
Broom looked at him through half-closed lids; his
lips were still parted, but the smile was gone. Then
he exploded. “Hang it all!” he said sulkily; “you
needn’t be hard on a fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, behave yourself, then,” said Roy, firmly,
and having spoken his mind he would have dropped
the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the other did not seem disposed to allow him.
“She’s a pretty little baggage for an Indian,” he
asserted, “and what’s more, she knows it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy directed a searching glance at the sneering
face of the speaker, but paid no attention to the remark
except, perhaps, that he raised his eyebrows a
little. He naturally possessed more self-control than
most young men of five and twenty. He was high-spirited,
and could not brook an insult; but he was
inclined to consider the source of a remark before he
retaliated. Besides, he wished to avoid another
quarrel, for he knew it would serve to widen the
breach already broad enough between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder some Indian brave hasn’t snapped her
up and carried her off to his happy wigwam,” Broom
went on. “But there!” he added, “I suppose she’d
turn up her pretty little nose at a native. She wants
a white man.” Then, with emphasis there was no
misunderstanding, “and no understrapper at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jumping to his feet, Roy stood before the fellow.
A flush of manifest vexation burned upon his cheek.
His hands clenched involuntarily. His eyes flashed,
but restraining himself, he said: “Look here, Broom,
that’s enough! I’ll have no more of your veiled insinuations,
or hear any more disrespectful remarks
about that girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor laughed quietly for a moment as if he
had some mighty good joke in his mind, then with a
half-deprecative, half-protesting movement of the
hand, “All right,” he said, “don’t get on your ear.
There’s no need for us to quarrel over a native.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I strongly object to the tone you adopt when
speaking of the girl,” persisted Roy, indignantly,
“and while we are on the subject I may as well tell
you that I will not tolerate any more of it. You are
my guest, so to speak, but my patience has an end,
and my hospitality its limits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom’s jaw dropped; he was evidently nonplussed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a silence. Broom’s eyes were fixed upon
the floor. He seemed to be considering. Roy turned
away to walk up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, stow it!” exclaimed Broom at last, without
raising his eyes. “You Hudson’s Bay men are not
so dashed good yourselves that you can afford to
lecture others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is as may be,” returned the trader sharply,
“but you see, I’m master here and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The king can do no wrong,” finished the other
sententiously. Then he laughed and suddenly extended
his hand. “Come, shake hands,” he cried.
“You’re not a bad chap in spite of your sanctimonious
airs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remark was evidently intended as an overture
of reconciliation. Roy stared hard at him for
a moment, then glanced at the outstretched hand. He
hated quarrelling, but he was feeling too angry at the
man to forgive him thus easily. The other noticed
Roy’s hesitation and look, and quickly dropped his
hand. Somewhat staggered, the fellow sat twisting
his moustache, pulling at his shaggy beard and
scowling at the trader, who had resumed his pacing.
After spending a portion of his discomfiture in this
manner, Broom again essayed a remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I was in the wrong,” he said, as if by way
of general retraction. “You’ve been a good friend
to me, in fact you saved my life. For when I drifted
in here, after deserting that blighted whaler, I was
all in; the winter was upon me, and, why! I hadn’t
enough clothes to flag a train.” At this he laughed
heartily. “You took me in, clothed me, and killed
the fatted caribou. Hang it, shake!” and he thrust
forth his hand again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy stopped perambulating. “Perhaps I’ve been
a little hasty,” he said, and took the man’s hand,
though he was still only half mollified, for this
sudden warmth of gratitude struck him as feigned.
“She is a demure, soft-hearted little thing, and I do
not like to hear her spoken of in that way,” he explained,
dropping into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course not!” observed Broom with a suggestion
of sarcasm in his tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father, Delgezie, works for me; he has
worked for the Company all his life,” continued Roy
severely, his eyes beginning to flash again. “He is
a pure-blooded Indian, a faithful servant, a gentle,
God-fearing old man, and his daughter, who was
orphaned at a very early age, is a very remarkable
girl. She was practically brought up by the missionary’s
wife at Churchill, you know, and her polite,
civilized manner and extraordinary intelligence
have attracted great attention and remark from
people travelling through the country; and I now
warn you: The man who fools with that girl will
have <span class='it'>me</span> to reckon with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor started and glanced at him for an instant
under his brows; the veins swelled at his
temples, and a dull, angry light came into his eyes.
“Oh, he will, will he?” he sneered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost as these words were uttered a dark face
was thrust into the room and a voice cried out in
Chipewyan. Roy answered in the same language
and the face disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom looked enquiringly at the trader, who was
pulling on a coat. The angry light was still in
Broom’s eyes, but his tone changed very much when
he spoke again. “What’s that he says?” he asked,
suavely. “I don’t understand that lingo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says there are Eskimo arriving,” replied Roy
shortly; and he went out to watch the approach of
the natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Broom half closed his eyes and an expression
of malignant and devilish hatred came over his face.
“So you threaten me, my Hudson’s Bay rooster,” he
murmured. “Well, you may crow in your own yard,
curse you, but don’t crow too loudly, for you don’t
own the earth.” Then, gently rubbing his wounded
lips, he added, almost in a whisper, and there was a
low hiss in the words: “And you shall pay dearly
for that blow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind was fair and the Eskimos came racing
before it at a great speed. Relieved of any effort by
the wind and sails, the dogs ran beside the flying
<span class='it'>com-it-uks</span> (Eskimo sleds) in apparent jubilation,
while the natives—with the exception of the two required
to steer each of these unwieldy, improvised
ice-boats—were sitting on the loads with smiles of
satisfaction, feeling that all was as it should be. As
they neared the Fort the big parchment sails were
dropped and the dogs brought into action. The number
of dogs attached to each <span class='it'>com-it-uk</span> varied, not
according to the weight of the load, as one would
imagine, but according to the total number possessed
by the Eskimos travelling with it. Where dogs were
lacking natives dropped into the vacant places and
hauled on the “bridles” (traces) as substitutes.
The heavily-laden sleds<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> were with difficulty dragged
to the warehouse where Roy stood, with door wide
open, ready to receive them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The odd commingling of tongues was confusing.
Roy was giving occasional sharp orders in Eskimo,
and holding scraps of conversation in his own tongue
with Broom, whom he had suddenly found standing
beside him, while the voluble Sahanderry ran about
loudly vociferating in Chipewyan. Added to this
was the hum occasioned by the Eskimos speaking
among themselves and the chorus of a few dozen dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new arrivals were all dressed alike in hairy
deerskin clothing, and scarcely anyone but a native
could have distinguished male from female, except
for a band of brass which some of the women wore
around their foreheads. Yet the trader was able to
greet each of the natives by name without making a
mistake, even when two brothers appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Oulybuck,” he cried, shaking hands with
a young Eskimo. “Where’s Piglinick? Isn’t he
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He’s dead,” returned the native.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead!” echoed Roy, with a look of profound
astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” continued the native, dryly, “we hung
him last moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hung him last moon!” repeated the horrified
trader, staring blankly at the broad-smiling Eskimo
for a few seconds, then bursting into a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beats cock-fighting,” observed Broom, sententiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Roy, recovering himself somewhat.
Then turning to Oulybuck, “Why did you hang
him?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Oulybuck ignored the question. “Hung Kinnicky,
too,” he said, smiling as if proud of this double
achievement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness me; why, he’s hung his father also!”
cried the astonished Roy. His face now changed its
expression to one of consternation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A regular Jack Ketch,” asserted Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us about it, Oulybuck. Why did you do
it?” asked Roy, who had become grave. He scarcely
knew what to make of such summary proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The native, nothing loth, told his story in a few
words, interspersed with long pauses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appeared that his father, Kinnicky, and his
brother, Piglinick, who had accompanied him the
last time he had come to the Fort, had been taken ill
shortly after starting on their return journey. As
days passed by and he got no better, Kinnicky decided
to end his sufferings. He bade Oulybuck build
him an <span class='it'>iglo</span> without the complete dome. This Oulybuck
dutifully did, and with the aid of a sled runner,
which was placed across the top of the structure
reaching from wall to wall, and a piece of clapmatch
line, which hung from the runner and terminated in
a noose, Kinnicky was left dancing in the air. This
somewhat unique cure seems to have recommended
itself to Piglinick also, for soon he was hanging beside
his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oulybuck finished his story with a look of conscious
pride at the part he had played in the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder where they got the idea of hanging,”
said Broom, breaking the silence that followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy shook his head. He was puzzled by the strange
yarn of the Eskimo; such proceedings appeared so
very barbarous, even in that remote country, far
from all law and order. Yet he thoroughly understood,
from his knowledge of the Eskimo character,
that the whole astounding performance had been carried
out by Oulybuck in perfect good faith. The
Eskimo had merely obeyed his father and elder
brother’s commands in assisting them to commit suicide,
the same as he would have implicitly obeyed
any other order they might have given him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Oulybuck was engaged with his story the
other Eskimos had chosen a suitable spot on which
to erect their <span class='it'>iglos</span> (snow-houses) and had started
to make them. Working in three gangs, they labored
on as many <span class='it'>iglos</span>. Cutting large blocks of snow from
an adjacent drift they carried them to other Eskimos,
who built them into walls around themselves. Dexterously
they trimmed the blocks with the <span class='it'>pin-uks</span>
(snow-knives), fitting them into place with great
exactness. Speedily the walls went up, and as they
grew in height so they decreased in circumference,
till at last only the heads of the builders could be
seen. Snow blocks were then neatly fitted to the
remaining spaces, and the men were immured in
prisons of their own construction; but they were
quickly released by their friends on the outside, who
cut holes through the walls near the base of the <span class='it'>iglos</span>
to serve as entrances. In front of these holes blocks
of snow were placed to act as doors; and the cracks in
the walls were sealed with loose snow. This completed
these primitive but serviceable snow houses
and they were quickly tenanted. In fact the whole
performance was marked by the expeditious way in
which it was accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the trader and his companion had returned
to the house and were now blowing clouds of
blue smoke. Broom sat in his favorite position with
feet resting on the bottom bunk, while Roy lounged
comfortably back with one leg dangling over the arm
of his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jumping up suddenly, Roy put a box of cigars and
two enamelled mugs upon the table, then produced
a bottle of whiskey from a locked box. He had resolved
to spend the evening as pleasantly as possible.
Pushing the cigars toward the sailor, he said, “Have
a cigar? Help yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom grinned appreciatively and complied with
ready acquiescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t care if I do,” he answered, taking one and
brightening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader drew the cork and passed the bottle to
his companion, who took it with sundry little chuckles
of satisfaction, and after several long approving
sniffs, poured out a goodly potation, which he tossed
off with a whimsical wink and a curt nod. Then his
hand went quickly to his mouth, and for a fleeting
second his face assumed a most unpleasant expression,
for the raw spirits stung his lips, which were
cut and bruised by contact with the trader’s fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look, however, passed unobserved by Roy, who
had taken the bottle and was helping himself moderately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good stuff,” sighed Broom, presently, gazing
affectionately into his empty mug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and very precious in these parts,” said Roy.
“I got only one case last fall; but I’ve managed to
make it hold out pretty well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly have,” returned Broom, putting
up his mug with apparent reluctance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the two men settled themselves in their
chairs and blew more clouds of smoke. Broom made
free with the box of cigars and sprawled himself out
comfortably, his face wearing an expression which
indicated that he was highly satisfied with himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he started chuckling to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the joke,” inquired Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was thinking of a fellow on the whaler,”
replied Broom, removing the cigar from his mouth
and gazing meditatively at the burning tip. “He was
hammering a dog one day when the skipper interposed.
‘You seem to have a spite against that dog,’
said the skipper. ‘No, I ain’t got no grudge against
the dog,’ said the fellow, ‘I’m just showing my
author-<span class='it'>i</span>-ity.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this the sailor fairly surpassed himself in
wit and good humor, and Roy was in constant bursts
of laughter at his stories and metaphors. Curious to
know the cause of this unusual mirth, Sahanderry
hastily finished his work in the kitchen, and stood in
the doorway listening to the conversation. The Indian’s
presence seemed to irritate Broom, who frequently
threw him a contemptuous glance and seemed
impatient to order him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Sahanderry,” said the trader, at length;
“you’re a hunter; give us a yarn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment the Indian’s name was mentioned
Broom’s face assumed a sneer and his eyes flashed
spitefully, for even in the short time he had been at
the Fort he and the Indian had for some reason
become bitter enemies. He shifted uncomfortably in
his chair, and appeared about to make some scornful
remark, but changed his mind and sat twisting his
moustache instead. Sahanderry’s face was immediately
suffused with smiles. He wiped his mouth
and cleared his throat. Then the smiles vanished
and his countenance took a solemn, mournful expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you about a <span class='it'>na-ra-yah</span> (wolverine),” he
said, moistening his lips with a thick tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire away, then!” cried Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian stood and preened himself a moment,
then started off in a stentorian voice, moving his
arms in unison. He told how a wolverine had been
caught in a trap that he had set for a fox, and how in
its struggles to get free it had broken the chain and
gone off with the trap attached to its foot. Gesticulating
wildly, the man got more and more excited as
he progressed with his story. A graphic description
of a <span class='it'>na-ra-yah</span> in <span class='it'>rigor mortis</span> was given. The Indian’s
uncouth antics and profound gravity in the
portrayal created great amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word, Sahanderry,” said Broom, when
the Indian had finished, “you are a most delightful
liar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry’s eyes flashed at this doubtful comment.
He appeared about to spring at his tormentor,
who was still twisting the ends of his moustache.
There was a moment of silence. The sailor sat looking
at the Indian with exasperating calmness. The
Indian breathed heavily, glaring at the sailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What right has Broom to call me a liar?” he
demanded, turning to Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broom! you black scoundrel, Broom!” cried the
man of the sea, “I’ll have you remember that I’ve
a handle to my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Broom-handle, then,” retorted Sahanderry
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor half rose from his chair in a gust of
passion as if he would make for Sahanderry, but
evidently changed his mind, for he dropped slowly
back to his seat. At a wave of the hand from the
trader, Sahanderry retired in a sulky mood to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time Broom forced a smile to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad for an Indian!” he admitted with dubious
praise, and with an attempt at a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned Roy shortly. Then he spoke of
the destructive habits of the wolverine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this juncture there was a slight shuffling noise
in the kitchen, accompanied by a sound of heavy
breathing. The noise drew nearer, and presently
with a long “Phew!” an Eskimo ushered himself
into the room. He paused for a moment as if to
make sure of his welcome, then at a nod from the
<span class='it'>A-hoo-mit-uk</span> (master) he squatted down where he
stood. It was Ocpic the Murderer, a sobriquet he
had earned, it was said by killing seven other
Eskimos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seating himself on his haunches in the doorway,
he divested himself of his <span class='it'>tko-ti-tok</span> (coat) by pulling
it over his head, and sat in his <span class='it'>at-ti-yi</span> (shirt), smiling
blandly, his little black, oblique eyes alertly
watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the two white men were engaged in conversation,
the Eskimo’s eyes wandered about the room
and eventually fixed themselves on a large key which
hung on a nail at the head of one of the bunks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little black eyes flashed and twinkled, for
their owner was aware that this key opened the trading
store—that little paradise which contained everything
dear to the Eskimo heart. Ocpic knew where
a new net hung, a fine new salmon net, made and just
ready to drop in the water; and he would be badly
in need of a net in the spring. There was nothing to
prevent his obtaining the net, nothing but that key.
He gave it a long earnest look, then suddenly dropped
his gaze and a crafty expression came on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Roy nor Broom noticed Ocpic’s prolonged
gaze at the key, nor observed the stealthy gleam
which came to Ocpic’s eye. They were speaking of
the manners and mode of life of these strange, littoral
people, who inhabit nearly five thousand miles
of seaboard from East Greenland to the Peninsula of
Alaska, and who throughout all that vast range speak
essentially the same language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They certainly are a peculiar race,” remarked
Roy in conclusion. “I have read somewhere that
they are an intermediate species between man and
the sea-cow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both men looked across at the Eskimo. He was
sitting in the same position and smiled it them as
they looked his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a voice at the door crying, “<span class='it'>Delgezie
yu-cuzz-ie, Bekothrie</span>” (Delgezie is coming,
master).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy jumped excitedly to his feet. He had heard
the voice, but had not distinguished the words, and
thought for a moment that the anxiously awaited
“packet” had been sighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delgezie,” said Sahanderry, shortly, putting his
head into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” and the trader’s face lengthened visibly.
He paused irresolutely, then reached down his
“hairy-coat” and fur cap and strode out of the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yawning prodigiously, Broom slowly rose to his
feet. Then he deliberately filled and lit his pipe,
pulled on a coat and stuck a cap on his head and
leisurely followed Roy, leaving Ocpic alone with
the key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These sleds, generally known as Eskimo sleds, are made
of two runners some thirty feet long, four inches deep
and two inches thick, and are mostly shod with whalebone,
but in its absence mud is used. This latter is put on hot
and allowed to freeze, then planed smooth and “iced” by
quickly drawing a streaming-wet piece of white bearskin
or blanket over it. This process of icing takes place every
night. Whalebone does not require icing, so has this
advantage over mud and is used altogether by the most
Northern Eskimo. Wooden bars are fastened across these
long runners at intervals of six inches, and a ground-lashing
of clapmatch line, or rope, run fore and aft on
either side. The load is lashed down to this. Very heavy
loads can be hauled on this kind of sled; in fact, ten
hundred pounds’ weight on an Eskimo sled is merely
equivalent to four hundred on a flat sled (toboggan). The
serious disadvantage of mud is felt in the spring, when the
mud thaws out and drops off in chunks.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span><h1>CHAPTER III.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>KASBA FIGHTS A BITTER FIGHT.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba sat on her narrow bed in a thoughtful and
melancholy posture. Her pretty oval chin rested in
the palm of her hand, and she leaned forward so that
her elbow rested on her knee and upheld the forearm.
She was gazing at her reflection in a small
hand-mirror, but without interest. In fact her gaze
was one of disparagement rather than of admiration,
and with a heavy sigh she let the glass fall into her
lap and sat lost in thought. The master was not in
love with her and she knew, as if by direct intuition,
that he had no intention of becoming so. There was
not the least chance for her any longer, and she threw
the glass behind her, somewhat petulantly it must
be admitted, and dropped her face into her hands;
for of what use was beauty if it did not win her the
man she loved? She had known him a long time,
many years it seemed to her, and had grown to love
him. Love him! oh, how she loved him! Yet in all
that time he had not spoken one word of love to her.
And now that she had showed him her heart perhaps
he despised her, or pitied her, which was worse. At
that she sprang to her feet. She was no longer the
calm, gentle-natured Kasba, but Kasba the Indian
in whose veins ran the blood of a great race. She
was a strange mixture of humility and pride, this
Indian maid. As she stood there, her head raised
proudly, her nostrils quivering, her eyes flashing, her
form rounded yet slight, her varying color, her tender
youth and singular grace of attitude would have inspired
an artist with the ideal of Indian beauty.
Then her eyes filled and she gulped down a sob. She
was feeling very bitter and rebellious. She felt that
she had a grudge against Fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To every pure and innocent young girl, we are told,
love is a condition of mind, not a strain on the senses.
But Kasba knew nothing of this. She had not the
conventional and sensitive delicacy of white
girls. She was well aware of life’s evil truths, and
knew that Broom would have gone to any lengths to
have possessed her. Roy was not that kind of a man;
though in her secret heart she wished that he had
been. Poor Kasba! She was such a child. Physically
she was quite grown up, but her mind was a
child’s mind. So confiding, so unprotected even by
her own sense of right, she would have gone to him
and not been aware of the fall. Was he not the
<span class='it'>Master</span>? And was she not his, body and soul?
Which goes to prove that Kasba’s notions of love were
very simple, rudimentary, and, certes, in no way coy.
How should they be?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the good lady at Churchill could have known
the girl’s state of mind at that moment she would
have been greatly startled and appalled and had serious
doubts as to whether her instruction, instead of
the service she had intended, had not unsettled the
girl and done her a deadly injury. It cannot be
denied that it was shocking, but all that the girl felt
was very natural. How should it be otherwise? Her
people had never been married, that is to say in the
white man’s way, until after the missionary had
come amongst them; still they had been happy, while
she had seen properly married white people who had
not lived happily together. She, who had seen but
few white people, had seen that, so what did it matter,
married or unmarried, as long as they were together?
So argued the girl, but deep down in her heart there
was the Churchill lady’s teaching, which was confused,
dim, uncertain, but clamoring to be heard,
and a guilty blush rushed to her cheek as she sat and
covered her eyes with her hands in very shame; for
she was conscious of the wickedness of what she felt
and longed for, though she could not understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she dropped her hands from her eyes
and sat bolt upright, staring at the wall opposite, and
gave a little shuddering sigh. For all at once she
understood that Roy had turned away because he
was honorable, because he wished to be true to another,
a girl of his own race, whom he loved. The
girl’s name was Lena. She knew that, for she had
once heard someone chaffing him about a girl of that
name and he had grown very red and confused. That
was very long ago, but it all came back to her now,
and she hated the girl Lena with her whole heart and
soul. Why did he love that other girl? In striving
to solve this riddle she was struck by a new idea. “He
cannot care for me,” she thought, “because my skin is
not white and I do not dress like the women of his
people,”—like the women did in the drawings she
had seen in some papers Roy had given her some time
or other. Doubtless this other girl’s—this Lena’s—dresses
covered her whole body, as the women’s did
in the pictures. She looked down at her own scanty
garment, which was nevertheless very serviceable
and becoming, though in sooth it might have displayed
the curves of her form to better perfection,
which left a considerable expanse of blue stroud legging
exposed; the blood mounted in a wave to her
face and throat and she kicked out her legs vexatiously,
viewing them with offence; then drew them
up beneath her as if to hide them forever from sight.
You could not see the women’s legs in the drawings
because their dresses covered them to the ankles.
Also they wore pretty hats instead of shawls, and
boots instead of ugly moccasins. Still they looked
very uncomfortable. Then she remembered how
heartily she and the boy David had laughed over the
pictures and wondered how white women could run
before dogs, or paddle a canoe, or even make bannocks
in such tight-fitting garments. As for herself, she
would be suffocated, she was sure she would. And
David had declared that he wouldn’t have one of
them for his partner on a trip for anything, not even
if she promised him a new gun, which was saying
much, and together they had poked fun and laughed
uproariously at the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Kasba! Had she known how little Roy
really troubled his head about her dress she might
have saved herself all this vexation of spirit. In
saying this I do not for one moment wish to make
our hero appear superior to other men. He was a
man, with all a man’s appreciation of what was beautiful
in women; but if truth forbids me to depict
Roy Thursby as a highly virtuous young man, justice
forces me to declare that the sight of this young
girl’s legs had never caused him an untoward thought,
though they were certainly not objects of offence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Kasba did not know what was in Roy’s mind,
and just then she would have risked suffocation or
any such horrible calamity to be able to display herself
before Roy for a few moments clothed after the
fashion of the women of his race. She snapped her
pretty white teeth like a little savage animal at the
thought of the white girl, whom she envied the possession
of civilized garments. She sat for a long
time cogitating over the shocking immodesty of her
costume. She could not have explained her thoughts
in these words, it is true; but this is really what
vexed her mind. Then her mood changed. A creature
of many moods was this Indian girl. Why
should she be ashamed of wearing her clothing
according to the custom of her tribe? Then she was
ashamed for ever having felt ashamed. Suddenly
she stopped this train of thought, also, and her face
clouded. Broom’s name had crossed her mind.
Then she remembered Sahanderry and her promise
to him, and thoughts crowded in upon her till her
brain reeled. She was a wicked girl, a very wicked
girl. How shocked her dear father would be if he
knew. And the man she loved who had turned away
that she might be an honest girl, what would he
think? Yes, she was very, very wicked. Filled
with disgust and loathing of herself she turned on
her face and lay violently sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she got up and lit a lamp. The fight
was over; she had conquered the evil thoughts that
had so cruelly beset her, which was due to her own
nature, in which there was much good and hardly
any evil. She had determined to face the situation
bravely, and do what was right, according to her ideas
of right, without any regard for her own feelings and
inclination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably Kasba had never heard of Satan’s proclivity
to provide employment for idle hands, but she
was seldom found idle, and chiding herself now for
the time she had wasted, in what she somewhat
vaguely called “her folly,” she began to make
“cakes” (bannocks) against her father’s return, for
she was expecting him home hourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So engrossed was she in her work that she did not
hear the door open, nor was she aware that David,
an orphan Indian boy whom Delgezie had adopted,
was in the house till a pair of cold arms caught her
round the neck, and a still colder face was pressed
against her own. Kasba drew the boy towards her
and stroked his cold face with her warm hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear,” she said with a welcoming smile,
“you gave me quite a start!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you thinking about, Kasba?” he
asked. Then, “Oh, I’ve shot three deer!” he cried
with boyish enthusiasm, without waiting for a reply.
Kasba was glad of the boy’s abstraction and bent a
tell-tale face over the half-cooked cakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must be hungry,” she said, handing the
boy one newly-baked which he took and began to
devour ravenously. He threw himself on the empty
sugar case and the cake disappeared in big mouthfuls,
while his large dark eyes flashed about the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a healthy-looking boy, with a bright,
happy face. The blood in his cheeks shone through
the dark skin, giving him a ruddy color pleasant to
look upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a remarkably short space of time David finished
his meal and his wandering eyes came back to the
girl by the stove. She was brewing a kettle of tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will go for the deer to-morrow,” she said.
“Why, you are getting quite a hunter! Is it far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this side of the ‘big hill.’” Then he
paused and his brow grew suddenly dark. “You’ve
been crying!” he exclaimed, fiercely, springing to his
feet. Then catching Kasba by the arm, he gazed
searchingly into her face. “What is it?” he cried
sharply. Dropping the girl’s arm he stood with
angry eyes and clenched fists. “Was it Ball-eye?”
(white-man, in this case meaning Broom) he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl hesitated and dropped her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Ball-eye,” he cried with conviction. “I
can see by your face it was.” Then waving his
clenched hands in the air he danced about the room
in fiery anger. “Curse him!” he shouted. “If
ever I catch him sneaking round after you, I’ll—I’ll
put a bullet in him, that’s what I’ll do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“David! David! Please don’t!” cried Kasba in
great dismay, seizing him round the neck. “You
must not talk like that. You will get into trouble.”
With this she sank on the seat he had vacated and
drew him down beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David’s anger died suddenly. He was now struggling
manfully to keep back the big tears which
threatened to overwhelm him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three deer! Why, David, you are getting quite
a man!” said Kasba, with a proud smile, changing
the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I have something very funny to tell
you,” he said quickly, forgetting his previous agitation
in his excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba gave him a smile of encouragement, while
he curled himself up comfortably at her feet, gazing
up into her face with bright, eager eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is this very funny thing you have to
tell me?” she asked, with lively interest, playfully
pinching his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he began seriously, “I was near the ‘big
lake,’ you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was watching a large buck deer. He was
windward of me and came right up close, quite unconscious
of my presence.” He paused and the girl
nodded again comprehendingly. “Go on,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” continued the boy, “I raised my rifle and
was about to fire when I heard a slight noise at my
back. I looked, and there on the edge of the lake
I saw three large wolves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl started and drew in her breath sharply.
“Three?” she asked, bending over and placing her
hand on his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, three,” repeated the boy. “They were
watching the deer, too, and acting so strangely that
I lowered my rifle and waited to see what they would
do. Presently two of them crouched down while
the other made off. Keeping out of sight it slunk
along till it got behind the deer, then the buck
‘winded’ it and sprang away straight to where the
two other wolves were crouching.” The boy paused
for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” cried the girl, “go on, go on!” In
her heated imagination she saw it all: the majestic
buck deer, the three fierce, gaunt wolves, and the
fearless boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David smiled again, pleased at the girl’s excitement.
“Just as the buck came up with the wolf at
his heels they sprang from their ambush and pulled
him down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then—” prompted the girl, looking at him
with her big, dark eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then I fired two bullets at them. I think
I wounded one. They stood and snarled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl shuddered and pressed his hand tighter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I fired again. This time I killed a big
grey fellow, the one which had run after the deer,
and the others made off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl drew a long, sharp breath, then, hugging
him tightly around the neck, kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David laughed and fought for breath. “Don’t
you think the wolves were very cunning?” he asked.
“Have you ever heard anything like that before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were very, very cunning,” declared the
girl. “It was wonderful, I have never heard the
like.” Then, stroking his hair caressingly, she
added very seriously: “It was very brave of you to
tackle three large wolves, David, but it was dangerous,
and I wish you would not go so far from the
Fort alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy smiled derisively at these girlish fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have my rifle!” he said bravely. Then
with a swagger he added: “But I must ‘ice’ my sled
ready for the morning,” and filling a tin mug with
lukewarm water, and taking a piece of bearskin from
off a shelf, he went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sigh Kasba took down a pair of birchwood
snowshoe frames from the rack overhead and sat
down to net them. The frames were her own handiwork
and well made; the wood had been cleverly
pared down, the cross-pieces and toes and heels beautifully
fitted and turned—all done, too, with only a
small knife, called a “crooked knife,” and an awl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But lest any of my readers should fall into the
error committed by the person who asked “whether
snowshoes were warmer than shoes of ordinary
wear,” I will here more fully describe how these
indispensable aids to winter perambulations are
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First four pieces of birch or juniper, as the case
may be, are carefully selected and cut into lengths
varying from three to five feet or longer, according
to the size of the snowshoes desired. These pieces
are then whittled down to an inch in thickness, and
each two fastened together at either end, bent to the
shape of an oblong oval, some ten inches across its
widest part, and turned up at the toe. Then the
slender frames thus made are strengthened at the
forepart by two crossbars, and at the heel by one
bar. This completes them and they are hung up to
dry. Later on they are netted in criss-cross fashion,
somewhat after the manner of a tennis racket, with
<span class='it'>babiche</span>, that is to say, narrow strips of undressed
deerskin, which are well wetted before using. The
foot netting, or in other words the netting on which
the foot rests, is much coarser than that used for the
heel and toe of the snowshoe. Of course I am
describing a Chipewyan snowshoe. Snowshoes differ
a little in shape among other tribes of Indians,
but the principle is the same.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>THE MAN OF THE SHADOWS.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Roy Thursby stood watching a small black speck
which was moving slowly over the white surface of
the river and coming in the direction of the Fort.
Overhead was a magnificent Aurora Borealis extending
high in bands of flickering color; a luminous
phenomenon of all the colors of the rainbow, oscillating
in electric waves. The gentle sighing of the
wind, and an occasional dull, muffled sound from
among the ice hummocks broke the silence. Near
the trader were the dark figures of Kasba and David,
in fact it was they who had given the alarm, and
presently there was a slight crunching sound and
Broom came striding up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dogs appeared as if by magic, and stood erect with
ears pricked up expectantly, or darted forward with
noses sniffing the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black speck grew rapidly larger and larger,
until presently it suddenly resolved itself into two
portions, one of which, the smaller of the two, quickly
mended its pace and was soon distinguishable as a
man. The other travelled much slower, in a serpentine
movement, swaying from side to side as it
dodged the huge masses of shattered ice. This was
a dog-train and driver returning from a trip to an
Eskimo encampment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long the man in front was clambering over
a prodigious snowdrift which obstructed the approach
to the trading-post. He was one Minnihak, an
Eskimo whom Thursby employed to run before the
dogs when he sent out a trading venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The native lumbered forward with a broad grin.
He was a droll figure from the hood of his <span class='it'>tko-li-tok</span>
(coat) down to his <span class='it'>ka-miks</span> (shoes) covered with
hoar-frost, and his “hairy” clothing gave him a
shaggy appearance greatly resembling a white bear
walking on its hind legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thursby went forward to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Timo</span>,” grunted the Eskimo; breathless from his
late exertions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Timo</span>,” responded the other. He was too interested
in the dog-train to take further notice of the
native just then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnihak took his welcome for granted. He
turned to look for his partner, who was now close
at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advancing train of dogs barked with sheer
delight at being so near home. Nothing could stop
them now; even the biggest laggard of a dog was in a
perfect frenzy to proceed. The dogs at hand heard
the song of those approaching and joined in the
melody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ignoring the track left by the guide and despising
every obstacle the arriving train came helter-skelter
over the bristling hummocks. The heavily laden
<span class='it'>com-it-uk</span> (sled), swaying dangerously, crashed
through the ice at an alarming speed. Up one side
of the snowdrift and down the other it flew, threatening
destruction to anything in its path, but a pull
here and a push there guided it safely past every
obstruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the home dogs vied with the newcomers in
making so great an uproar that no human voice could
possibly have made itself heard above the pandemonium.
A free fight ensued, but a few sharp,
stinging cuts from the well-directed lash of a whip
drew the dogs’ attention to other things. Then the
pain of their wounds broke in upon them and they
slunk off with whines and yells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the aid of Minnihak and Sahanderry the dogs
were unharnessed and the heavily loaded sled taken
away. Roy then turned to speak to Broom, but that
individual had suddenly disappeared; and Kasba,
possessing herself of her father’s bag containing a
deerskin robe and a change of footwear, also went
silently away, while some distance ahead of her was
David, staggering under a load of venison that Delgezie
had given him to carry home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the girl moved away from the fort a dim figure
appeared in the deep shadow at a corner of one of
the buildings and stood looking after her. When she
had disappeared among the rocks the watcher
chuckled and followed after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slight crunch, crunch, of some one walking
stealthily over the crisp snow soon attracted Kasba’s
attention. Twice she stopped to listen, throwing a
scared glance behind. The third time a voice close
at hand startled her, and she stopped dead and turned
right round. A dozen feet away, in the shadow of
a large boulder she discovered an indistinct figure
standing. The girl stood inert, staring as if fascinated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kasba, wait a minute, I want you,” said the
voice in carefully modulated tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—do—you—want—with—me?” faltered
the maiden, now thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to speak to you,” said the voice. Kasba
shivered. She swayed and almost fell, for it was
the voice of the man she so greatly feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want—I don’t understand,” she
faltered, trying to move away, but now her legs
refused her bidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you needn’t be afraid,” said the man, stepping
out of the shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not so scared of Bekothrie, I notice,” he
added with meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is the master!” faltered the girl, her face
flushing painfully, wondering whether the fellow had
guessed her secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course,” laughed Broom unpleasantly, and
slyly edging nearer. “The master, and therefore a
little tin god. But say,” he added, taking a step or
two boldly, “does he not kiss those pretty lips occasionally,
and embrace that tight little waist, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should he?” asked the girl stupidly,
scarcely knowing what to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should he?” repeated Broom, chuckling.
“Why indeed! Why, because he is human, my
dear, and can no more resist the fascination of your
pretty face and figure than I can.” Kasba remembered
how easily Roy had resisted her that very day
and, despite the terror she was feeling, smiled bitterly.
While the fellow had been speaking he had
craftily reduced the space between them, and now,
encouraged by the girl’s silence, he tried to clasp her
about the waist. But the action worked upon the
girl like magic. There was too much of the fighting
blood of her warrior ancestors in her to allow her to
be terrified for long, and though her expression of
strong aversion never changed, she stopped trembling
and with perfect calmness skilfully eluded his grasp.
His arm encircled the empty air and he swore under
his breath. “Oh, you needn’t try to be so confoundedly
coy,” he cried, baffled for the moment. “Come,
sweetheart,” he added, waxing passionate and insinuating
and again edging toward her, “I’m in love
with you and shall sleep all the better for a kiss from
those red lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back, Ball-eye,” cried the girl, her eyes flashing
and her lips curled in scorn. “I do not like you.
Why do you persist in troubling me when I dislike
you and try to keep aloof?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhat staggered, the fellow gnawed savagely
at his moustache. “Bah!” he exclaimed at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not like you,” continued the girl staunchly.
“There is something here,” she added, touching her
breast, “that tells me that you are a very wicked man
and will bring trouble upon us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I, my pretty divinator, have something
here,” retorted the man, tapping his breast in imitation
of her, “that tells me that you are a canting
little hypocrite, and, by God, I will have that kiss!”
With that he took a step toward her, then stopped and
stared hard at the girl, who stood silent and immobile
as a statue, facing her tormentor with no apparent
fear. She did not even start on hearing the
threat, but on the contrary faced him boldly, her
foot planted firmly, looking him steadily in the eye.
Then deliberately she drew a long knife from her
bosom and, grasping it tightly, held it ready for use.
She eyed him grimly, and softly chuckled. Her
terror was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fellow fell back, sullen, foiled. Kasba’s fearless
attitude utterly disconcerted him, and he blasphemed
till the girl shuddered and turned her back
and moved away. But her face was no sooner turned
than a very strange expression came on Broom’s, and
rushing after her, he cried in a loud, angry voice:
“Not so fast, you little wildcat. You shall pay me
for those false smiles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a boy’s clear voice rang out on the still
night air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Kas-ba-a, yu-cuz-zie, yu-cuz-zie Kas-ba-a!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a smothered imprecation the man stopped
dead in his tracks. Then at the sound of someone
approaching he dropped hurriedly back into the
shadow. Suddenly an idea crossed his mind. He
stood a moment chewing his moustache thoughtfully,
and nodding his head once or twice. “I’ll do it,”
he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Roy entered the house, after giving Delgezie
a few supplies from the store, he was astonished to
find Broom had not come in; apparently he must
be outside talking to Sahanderry or Minnihak. Dismissing
the matter from his mind, he turned to Delgezie,
who had followed to make his report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing back his hood, Delgezie displayed a
pleasant, wrinkled face. But there was the sad,
wistful expression in his eyes of one who has experienced
some overwhelming sorrow, and yet was conscientiously
striving to live out his life bravely
despite it. He seated himself at a nod from his
master, who plied him with questions relative to the
trip. It had been a very successful one. They had
brought back a good haul of furs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Acpa?” questioned Roy presently, referring
to one of his Eskimo traders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His boy’s sick,” said Delgezie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he met with an accident. His father shot
him in the leg; the gun went off accidentally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurt him much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, completely shattered the bone below the
knee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they doing to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve tied a piece of shaganappi tightly
around the leg, above the wound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the world for?” asked Thursby, in
blank surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the line will cut through the flesh,” said
Delgezie, unmoved, “and the lower part will rot off,
clean off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens!” exclaimed the other. “Is that
possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The greater part of the flesh below the
shaganappi is off already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How ghastly!” said the trader, with a slight
shudder. “But the boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s lively enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well! we live and learn,” said Thursby.
“What would a doctor say of such primitive surgery?”
he wondered. “But there, I won’t keep you
any longer,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man got to his feet instantly. With a
cheerful “Good-night, sir,” he left the room. Outside
he was joined by Minnihak, and the two proceeded
to Delgezie’s hut together. On the way they
met an Eskimo woman, whom they passed with a
slight greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With characteristic curiosity she turned and
watched them. She was a “runner.” A band of
Eskimo had found it impossible to reach the post
that day and had sent her on in advance to get the
usual gratuity of <span class='it'>tee-pli-tow</span> (tobacco) and carry it
back to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Chipewyan’s face brightened when he
approached his humble home, where a pale light welcomed
him from the window. He lifted the catch
softly, while a look of pleased anticipation stole over
his face, for was he not to see his only child whom
he loved better than anything on all God’s earth?
He had been away from her many days—long, weary
days, haunted by the fearful dread that he might
return to find her gone, as her mother had gone
years before. For there was a tragedy in the old
man’s life. Leaving his wife in the best of health,
he had gone on a trip to an Indian encampment, and
had returned to find her dead and buried. She had
died of some contagious disease. This was a terrible
blow to him, for he loved her fondly. He had shortly
before embraced the Christian faith, and this great
affliction—this taking away of all he loved best on
earth—tried the simple-hearted man sorely. It
seemed monstrously unjust. He probably could not
have put his feelings into words, but that was what
he felt. It was hard for him to believe in a God
who could do this thing—a God whom the missionary
invariably presented as a “God of love.” What
had he done to deserve such misery? All that was
just and righteous in the gentle-minded man rose
up in revolt. And was this to be wondered at?
How many of us so-called highly-civilized people have
not at some time or other questioned the wisdom of
God with infinitely less cause? Well, then, may we
sympathize with this poor, uneducated, half-pagan
Indian. The bereaved man’s grief was terrible to
witness. For days he sat disconsolate and desolate,
moaning to himself, and neither eating nor sleeping.
When the missionary called to comfort him, he rose
slowly to his feet and in a voice that cut the preacher
to the heart cried: “My wife, where is she?” Then
with a sweep of the arm to take in the whole of his
tribe, he asked: “Was there no other woman your
God could take?” The missionary, greatly distressed,
felt that the kindest thing he could do was
to go away. Time passed on and the poor fellow
again took up his accustomed duties. But he was
never afterwards the same man. He never forgot
his dead wife and secretly and sincerely mourned her
all the rest of his days. He never took another, but
showered all the love of his bruised heart upon his
orphaned child, and never left the Fort without an
overwhelming fear that something might happen to
his treasure while he was away. But he was home
again now and all was well. The <span class='it'>com-it-uk</span> had
claimed most of his attention when he had driven
up to the Fort, but his eyes nevertheless sought
eagerly for Kasba, whom he discovered standing
meekly in the background after her wont, ready to
carry his “bag” to the house. They had not yet
spoken, for Kasba never intruded herself when
Bekothrie was nigh. She knew her father’s work
came first. But she was inside the house, he well
knew, to welcome him; and never did a lover’s heart
flutter and throb as did the heart of this poor old
home-coming Indian father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True to his expectations, his daughter was waiting
for him within. She was standing by the stove.
Instantly the girl’s face glowed with pleasure, and
with a little cry of delight she flew to him and, encircling
his neck with her arms, drew his face down
on a level with her own, and gazed searchingly into
it for a moment, as if to see whether he had taken
any harm during his long absence. The old man
gave a short, contented laugh, then his feelings welled
up within him and tears of joy gleamed in his eyes.
Reluctantly putting her from him, he took off his
out-door garments while Kasba greeted the Eskimo
and flew back to the stove, on which a pot was boiling
merrily. A savory smell filled the room but the old
man remarked it not. His eyes were following his
daughter’s movements with the wistful gaze of loving
solicitude. He paused in the act of drying his
hands on a coarse towel to smile whenever his eyes
caught hers in her flittings. His ablutions completed,
Kasba helped him into his jacket. Then,
taking him by the shoulder she playfully forced him
to a seat. The Eskimo seated himself at the table
at a gesture from Kasba, and soon food was set before
the men. Hardly a word was exchanged between
them, and in a marvellously short space of time they
had finished supper and were feeling for their pipes.
Fumbling in one pocket after another, Delgezie
pulled out pipe, knife and a plug of nigger-head from
profound depths. Then he proceeded to cut up
enough of the tobacco to fill his pipe. Minnihak
produced his <span class='it'>pu-lu-yet-ti</span> (pipe) from his fire-bag
and with scrupulous carefulness filled its little black
bowl with a mixture of tobacco and a particular kind
of weed which grows among the rocks in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This <span class='it'>pu-lu-yet-ti</span> had been fashioned from soft
stone and ornamented with little brass bands in a
manner and after a pattern peculiar to the Eskimo.
The stem was of wood and frequently renewed. But
the old stems were never thrown away; they were
hoarded up against a tobacco famine when they would
be cut up very fine and smoked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men smoked in silence. Minnihak drew
lovingly at his pipe long after the little bowl was
empty. Then with a deep sigh of regret he reluctantly
put it away, and drawing his <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span> (deerskin
robe) over him, he stretched himself on the floor
to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her duties completed, Kasba sat down beside her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy’s asleep,” said Delgezie, with an indicative
thrust of the chin in the direction of a recumbent
figure in a corner of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” laughed the girl, with a glance in the same
direction. “Poor David, he tried to keep awake,
but he was so very tired. He was away on the ‘big
hill’ hunting, all day. He shot three deer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” ejaculated the old man with a nod and
smile of approbation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going for them to-morrow,” she explained,
taking her father’s hand and smoothing it fondly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then the door opened and Broom appeared.
He hesitated on the threshold, glancing from one to
the other as if asking permission to enter. Kasba
half started up from her seat at sight of him. She
experienced a feeling of resentful surprise, wondering
what his visit might portend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man bade him enter, though he seemed
rather taken aback at the fellow’s presence. The
welcome obviously lacked fervor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing daunted, Broom came forward with a
peculiar smile on his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba rose hastily and placed a seat for him, then
turned deliberately away, withdrawing to another
part of the room, and for the time being appeared
totally absorbed in some kind of needlework.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, old man,” said Broom, breaking the
strained silence, “what sort of a trip did you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty fair, sir,” Delgezie made brief reply.
Then he nervously moved his hands and his eyes went
to the girl. Delgezie certainly looked upon Broom
with much disfavor. Suddenly he straightened up
a little and looked the sailor full in the face. “What
do you want?” he demanded bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom appeared a trifle confused by this direct
question. He glanced at the girl before answering,
then: “Oh, nothing much?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie nodded doubtfully, his eyes fastened on
the fellow’s face. Something in his manner had
startled and displeased him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Conversation lagged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intruder fidgeted uneasily under the old
man’s solemn scrutiny. He changed his position
several times. Then he suddenly produced a cigar
and offered it to the old man, who refused it point
blank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No thank you,” said the old fellow, with grim
brevity, “I’m used to the pipe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom bit off the end of the rejected cigar savagely,
and sticking it into his mouth applied a match.
Again he glanced at the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time Delgezie caught the direction of his
glance and instinctively his attention was alert. A
shade of uneasiness came into his eyes; his mind
was filled with vague alarms. With puckered brows
he sat silently watchful and suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Kasba the constraint became unbearable. She
softly opened the door and went out. The closing of
the door was the first warning Broom received of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned half round and sat for a few moments
in a listening attitude. Then he turned back, and
leaning forward toward Delgezie, “Look here, old
man,” he said, laughing oddly, “what I’ve come
to see you about is this: I want your girl—” He
left the sentence unfinished; there was that in the
old man’s face that caused him to stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Delgezie had turned white, his lower jaw
dropped, his eyes set in a fixed, horrified stare; he
breathed heavily. So paralyzed was he at the news
that he lost his faculties. Something like a groan
escaped his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—want—my—daughter!” he gasped, at
length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do,” replied Broom, mercilessly, with
another odd laugh. “I’m in love with her. Course
I can’t marry her properly here, we haven’t a parson;
but I’m going south first open water and will
take her along. We can get hitched up then, at
Churchill. In the meantime an Indian marriage
will have to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look in the old man’s honest eyes caused
Broom’s to wander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the old fellow shakily, “I can’t give
you my girl. She’s all I’ve got.” His voice broke
and a tear showed on his cheek. “Besides,” he
added, pulling himself together, “you don’t love her;
you say you do, but by and by—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what you mean. You mean I would
grow tired of her and throw her off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the brave old Indian, slowly, “that’s
what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom laughed harshly. “You’re candid, at any
rate, old man; but you’re wrong. Besides, how do
you know that the girl don’t want me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can ask her yourself, in front of me,” replied
Delgezie with honest indignation. And rising
slowly, he crossed the room and went out. Broom
heard the old man’s voice in conversation outside for
a few moments, then he returned, leaving the door
ajar behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after, the girl came in. “Well!” she said
quietly, yet with a touch of defiance in her voice, and
facing Broom boldly. Her eyes were wide and
flashing, her lips compressed. She looked at him in
a manner which despite himself caused him to feel
somewhat abashed and his face to crimson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fellow <a id='seem'></a>seemed too confused to speak for a
moment. Then: “I’ve been asking your father for
you, Kasba,” he said, somewhat brusquely, as if
intending to carry off the matter with a high hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl displayed no surprise. She looked him
squarely in the face for a moment, then: “Do you
mean that you wish to <span class='it'>marry</span> me?” she asked with
rather marked emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I would; but I can’t, very well,” he explained.
“I’d do it fast enough, but there ain’t
any parson here. I reckon you’d think a sky-pilot
necessary—” He paused and looked at her searchingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she would not help him. She stood grimly
silent, gazing at him with an inscrutable face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shifted uneasily under the intensity of her
gaze. Her attitude stirred his wrath. Who in the
world was she that she should put on airs? She had
been spoilt. Just because she was pretty she had
been petted and made much of! But—just wait!
D—— her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still we could get married—” he continued, as
she did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s lip curled, and he left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“According to <span class='it'>native</span> custom,” she finished scornfully.
“Oh!” There was great significance in the
exclamation. She threw back her head proudly, and
her nostrils widened. She surveyed him from head
to foot in one sweeping glance of contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom smiled. It was a disagreeable smile and
his brows lowered. There came an unpleasant glint
in his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going to her father, who had resumed his seat,
she knelt down beside him. The old man took her
hand and held it tightly. “Father,” she said firmly,
“I shall never marry in that fashion. You would
not wish me to do so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The staunch old fellow shook his head decidedly.
“No, my child,” said the downright old fellow.
“We are Indians, it’s true; but we are also Christians.
No, I do not wish it, nor would I allow it.”
There was much righteous indignation in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christians!” sneered Broom, in a manner so
diabolical that it is quite beyond power of description.
“<span class='it'>Fine</span> Christians, I’m sure. But I’m up to
your little game. You think to make a fine lady of
the girl, eh? She’s throwing herself at Thursby’s
head, and if—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” commanded Delgezie, sternly. Gently
disengaging himself from the girl, he got to his feet.
Raised to his full height, he looked upon the slanderer
with a face which, in truth, was fearful. His
eyes brightened into clear and perfect fire. He
stood, a concentration of scorn, contempt, hatred the
most intense; pouring upon the dastardly villain an
unbroken stream of withering fury that was dreadful
to look upon. His daughter, in fact, was obliged
to speak twice before she could arrest his attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father! father!” she pleaded. She was greatly
frightened. She had never seen this kind-hearted
old man in such a fierce passion before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of the girl’s voice, Delgezie partly
recovered himself. The anger went slowly out of
his face, leaving it grim and stern. “You have
received your answer,” he said with dignity. “You
have no right to insult us. Please go.” With that
he resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Broom was angry, too. For an instant he had
a wicked desire to seize the girl and carry her off,
but he could not do this without being followed
and brought back, and his punishment would be
severe. Roy had already declared himself on that
score. Besides there would be this fiery old father
to deal with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have her yet,” said Broom, starting to take
his leave, “I swear it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door he turned and glanced maliciously
back at the girl, then laughing discordantly he strode
out, banging the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a great, horrible fear seizing Delgezie
seemed to still the beating of his heart. For Broom
had sworn that he would possess Kasba. Broom was
a white man, and white men always got what they
set their hearts upon; that is, when dealing with
Indians. At least, such was Delgezie’s experience.
He must consult Bekothrie. Yet it seemed a silly
thing to make a fuss about. It was no insult to
offer a girl marriage, and, if pressed by Bekothrie,
Broom would undoubtedly construe his offer as such.
Besides the fellow had been refused, and that should
end the matter, and probably would, when he had
had time to recover from his ruffled feelings. If he
then refused to take the rejection in good part and
continued to annoy the girl with his attentions, it
would then be time to complain to Bekothrie. So
argued the old fellow, who was not a little shrewd
in his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like that man, my girl?” he asked with
exceeding tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t, and never shall,” Kasba replied firmly.
“And oh, father, I never want to leave you. You
are the best father any girl ever had.” Then with
a laugh she kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his hand up and stroked her cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the time comes, little girl, and the right
man asks, your father won’t refuse him,” Delgezie
assured her in his slow, thoughtful way. “But in
God’s name let it be a man of your own kind, an
Indian. You were trained in the white man’s ways,
and taught to read and write English, but you are
still an Indian, my dear; nothing could alter that.
You are what the good God intended you should be—a
Chipewyan Indian girl; and to be ashamed of it
would be to doubt His wisdom. But there,” he
added hastily, trying to hide his emotion, “you are
going to the ‘big hill’ to-morrow, so must be off to
bed. Give me the books.” He drew the lamp
toward him as if to obtain more light to read by, but
in reality his poor old eyes were dim with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba sprang to her feet and brought two Chipewyan
books, a hymn and a prayer book. These she
handed to her father, who fumbled at the leaves of
the hymn-book for some moments with a thoughtful
frown. Then suddenly, “<span class='it'>A Neolt ye sesal naothat
da</span>” (Abide with me), he sang in a thin, tremulous
voice. Kasba joined in the hymn, but in subdued
tones, fearing to wake David, who moved uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair then fell on their knees and Delgezie
read the “general confession,” concluding with
“<span class='it'>Neta Yaka thenda nese</span>” (Our Father, who art).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long after her father’s deep breathing told her that
he was asleep, Kasba lay gazing at a shaft of moonlight
that pierced the small window. Her mind
dwelt with bitterness on the harshness of her situation:
Broom’s persistent attentions; Roy’s indifference
to her love; and her promise to Sahanderry
necessitated important changes in her life. In
future she must no longer roam the Fort unattended;
no longer spend the quiet hours thinking of Bekothrie.
Instead, she must always be accompanied in
her ramblings, must think of Bekothrie no more, and
accept Sahanderry as her lover.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span><h1>CHAPTER V.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>AN ESKIMO CONJURER AND A PUGILISTIC ENCOUNTER.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Early next morning Roy was in the inner room
making a protracted search for the store key, which
had mysteriously disappeared from the nail on which
it had hung the night before. Suddenly discontinuing
his efforts, he strode into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry was standing near the door in earnest
conversation with Kasba, who had apparently just
arrived with a message from her father. Squatted
beside the stove was the Eskimo, Ocpic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy nodded to the girl, who discreetly drew aside,
then questioned Sahanderry, who instantly assured
him of his total ignorance of the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still pondering over the disappearance of the key,
Roy suddenly raised his eyes and encountered those
of Ocpic, who was watching him keenly. In a flash
Roy perceived the culprit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced searchingly at the Eskimo, who returned
the look with an inscrutable face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy smiled and flashed a glance at Sahanderry,
who was standing with a puzzled expression, gazing
from one to the other of them. The Chipewyan’s
brain worked slowly, ponderously. It was some
little time before a suspicion of what was in the
other’s mind dawned upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy beckoned him with a slight movement of the
head and then went outside. The Indian lingered
for a few moments before following with an awkward
attempt at careless ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Ocpic,” declared Roy, vehemently, without
preamble, as Sahanderry joined him. “Of
course it was he! I left him in the room with the
sailor when I went out to Delgezie, and the sailor
followed. But you,” he demanded quickly with a
wrathful look, “what were you thinking of that you
allowed the Eskimo to stay alone in the room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The delinquent dropped his head guiltily, expecting
a storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now go in,” continued the speaker peremptorily.
“Try to keep Ocpic in the kitchen while I fix
up a plan to get the key away from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servant acquiesced gladly, and quickly disappeared
into the house. Roy followed more leisurely.
He spoke jocosely to Kasba as he passed through the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the inner room he threw himself into
a chair to form his plans to outwit the Eskimo. In
the dilemma his knowledge of the native character
stood him in good stead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A feasible way presenting itself, he called the
Eskimo forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic entered with a solemn face. There was a
menacing gleam in his eye. Roy knew at a glance
that the native’s suspicions were aroused; that he
was prepared to deny any knowledge of the key with
mule-like obstinacy. It had been mislaid by himself,
Roy explained, or it had dropped from his
pocket, as the case might be. Ocpic had often
boasted of his feats as a conjurer. Let him find the
key and the trader would consider him as clever
as he made himself out to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo hesitated. The trader twitted him
with his incapability as a conjurer, laughing at his
hesitation to comply with such a simple request.
However, if Ocpic refused to find the key, he had
only to change the lock on the store door and the
key would be of no use to anyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic glanced searchingly at Roy, but his face had
assumed such a bland, innocent expression that any
suspicion Ocpic might have had was instantly
allayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo was now on his mettle. He felt his
reputation as a conjurer at stake. He hesitated a
moment longer while the thought of the change of
locks sank into his brain. He had instantly perceived
that the stolen key would then be of no use
to him, and so, his face assuming his old simple,
ingratiating smile, he gave a ready assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would bring his conjuring belt, he said, and
left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader laughed inwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a short absence Ocpic again presented himself.
He held a large <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span> (deerskin robe) in
his hand and wore around his waist a belt of string,
to which rags of different material and color and
sundry tiny parchment ornaments had been attached.
This belt was the insignia of his office.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering the room, Ocpic made arrangements for
the coming performance with the profoundest gravity,
while the trader watched him with a twinkle of
amusement in his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The native seemed to have some difficulty in finding
a suitable spot on the floor, but at length chose
a place near the door, where he squatted down, drawing
the <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span> over his head and completely enveloping
himself therewith. When this was accomplished
to his own satisfaction, he began a mumbled
incantation, interspersed with much scratching on
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conjurer’s voice swelled into a loud song as
the ceremony progressed. The <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span> heaved,
while the figure beneath seemed to be engaged in
a violent struggle, presumably with some turbulent
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the noise made by Ocpic had gradually
stirred Broom’s senses. He slowly awoke, raised
himself on one elbow, and gazed at the heaving <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span>
as if fascinated. He brushed his hand across
his eyes sharply as if to make sure he was thoroughly
awake, then threw another hasty, startled glance in
the same direction. Presently he smiled grimly as
the import of the scene grew clear to him. After
watching the Eskimo’s struggles for some moments
longer, Broom dropped his legs over the side of the
bunk and sat in a stooping position. He was occupying
the lower bunk and the limited space above
would not allow him to sit upright. He then
noticed Roy’s presence for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the bally performance?” he inquired,
catching a glance from the trader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve lost the key of the trading store, and
Ocpic’s finding it for me,” responded Roy. The
conjurer was still enveloped in the <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span>, and,
taking advantage of this, the speaker closed an eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom’s eye twinkled. “Ah,” he said significantly
with a smile and a meaning glance at the
struggling bulk, which was now undergoing astounding
evolutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later a tremendous upheaval occurred
and the Eskimo’s head appeared. He sat blinking
at Roy, his overheated countenance perspiring profusely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spirit wants to know what kind of key it
is,” he said breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A big key,” returned the trader, illustrating its
length with his two index fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic nodded comprehendingly, gazed seriously
around the room for a moment, then, taking a long
breath, again disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two white men glanced at each other and
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow’s <span class='it'>some</span> conjurer,” asserted Broom,
whose voice seemed to betray a considerable appreciation
of the ludicrous element in the incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sure is,” said Roy, with a broad grin; “the
best in the land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom started to laugh, but a sharp look from Roy
turned it to a prolonged yawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conjurer’s previous herculean efforts were
mere child’s play compared to the superhuman display
that followed. The intervals of scratching
became continuous, the incantations swelled into a
roar and the twisting figure beneath the <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span>
worked itself into a frenzy. Then suddenly all was
still and a closed hand pushed itself out through the
covering. The grimy fingers and the thumb slowly
opened, disclosing the wards of a large key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the key?” asked a muffled voice from
beneath the <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Roy without moving from his seat
to examine the thing in the extended hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fingers and thumb closed back on the object
and the hand again disappeared. Ocpic’s voice was
then heard in conversation. After a time the attendant
spirits were, apparently, dismissed, for the figure
arose. The <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span> fell to the floor in a heap and
the Eskimo stood revealed, smiling and perspiring.
With a proud look he held a large key extended on
his open palm. The trader slowly took it, then, like
a flash, his expression of careless indifference disappeared
and his face took on a look of implacable
wrath. Reaching for the fallen <span class='it'>kaip-puk</span> he hurled
it into the kitchen as far as he could throw it; then
turning to the Eskimo, he grasped him firmly by the
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a thief,” he cried. “You stole the key.”
With this he gave the astonished Ocpic a shake which
nearly sent him off his feet. “If ever I find you in
this room again I will shoot you,” he added sternly.
“Now go.” Ocpic breathed heavily, his face worked
passionately, then suddenly he gave a loud shout.
Hatred, the implacable hatred of a coward, flashed
from his eyes as he did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if by magic the doorway was filled with angry
faces. A number of Eskimos shuffled in and made
an effort to draw near to Ocpic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietly Broom dropped from the bunk to the floor.
Deliberately he reached for a chair. Then he took
his place beside Roy, balancing the chair in his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a slight figure pressed itself through the
group at the door. It was Kasba. Roy looked at
her surprised, and smiled. Straightening herself,
she faced Ocpic’s allies with outstretched hand and
eyes aflame and stood as if warning them back, a
veritable little fury. For a moment the Eskimos
wavered, then they murmured together and moved
as if to push past the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy smiled grimly. He was conscious of feeling
a slight exultation at the prospect of a conflict with
the natives, for the old race antagonism was strong
in him. He knew the moment of his life had come,
that to show the least fear now was to lose command
over these people forever. All depended upon a bold
front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly he motioned Broom back. Then he
gently brushed Kasba aside. Stern and fearless he
strode up to Ocpic, who never moved a muscle.
With blazing eyes Roy pointed to the door. He
looked particularly big in his wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hilimee!</span>” (Go!), he barked. The command was
not one to be ignored. He seemed with his stern
visage and flashing eyes to be very earnest indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tense silence. The two men gazed
fixedly into each other’s eyes; then, as invariably
happens, the native quailed before an unflinching
outward manifestation of the stronger will. Ocpic’s
eyes dropped sullenly. He turned and shuffled out.
The group at the door had already melted away, as
silently as it had appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy turned to speak to Kasba, but found her gone.
The danger past, she had vanished. The two white
men silently gripped hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later Sahanderry appeared with a
trembling, scared face; so terrified was he at what
had just transpired that he quaked with terror. He
kept muttering to himself while he laid the table for
breakfast. Evidently he expected Ocpic to take
summary vengeance by a murderous act similar to
one of which he was already declared guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having recovered the key, Roy decided to go alone
to the trading-store to ascertain the extent of Ocpic’s
peculations, and with this intention struggled into
his hairy-coat and was about to leave the room when
an enamelled plate fell with a loud clatter from
Sahanderry’s trembling fingers to the floor. This
drew Roy’s attention to the Indian’s state of extreme
nervousness. He looked fixedly at him for a moment
and then spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sahanderry,” he said in a voice that made the
man addressed spin round as if shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bekothrie!” gasped the Indian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader quietly held his gaze until the other
had somewhat mastered his agitation, then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a fool,” he added sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These peremptory words, coupled with the speaker’s
perfect coolness, had the desired effect. Assuming
courage borrowed from Roy’s composure, Sahanderry
continued his labors with less nervousness, but
heavily and with scant interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom, who was feeling “as fresh as a daisy,”
returned to his seat on the edge of the bunk, where
he sat warbling scraps of songs of questionable morality
in a harsh, grating voice, like the rasping of
dull metal, beating a tattoo meanwhile with the heels
of his naked feet and throwing Sahanderry an occasional
glance to see how he was appreciating these
efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange to say, Sahanderry was far from being
offended at the levity of the singer, and hovered
about the table with an approving smile on his dark
face long after he had completed his duties. Perceiving
his apparent interest, Broom threw himself
into the attitude of a preacher and with inscrutable
face severely lectured the Indian on his indiscretion
in listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a hardened sinner, my man,” he
declared sharply. “Mind what you are about, or
you will come to a bad end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This admonition discomfited Sahanderry for the
moment, then he threw the incorrigible Broom a
look of infinite scorn and abruptly walked out with
his head in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone, the other delivered himself of a rattling
chorus as a grand finale, then, dropping on his
feet, he pulled on his clothes with a dexterity almost
incredible. In a few moments Mr. Broom was
dressed and out of doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast the trader rose from the table and
paced the room restlessly. “That packet!” he murmured,
sighing a little. “How I wish it would
turn up. For some unaccountable reason my fiancée’s
letters missed connection last mail; I haven’t
heard from her for a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, a whole twelve months!” cried his companion
with a theatrical start of horror. “A year
without a ‘billy-doo.’ What a calamity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy made a playful lunge, which the other skilfully
avoided, then, laughing good-naturedly at
Broom’s banter, he attired himself and went out, but
he did not remain out of doors long, quickly returning
and wandering listlessly about the place during
the rest of the morning. He was too anxious about
the “packet” to attend his traps or settle himself
to anything about the Fort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom made himself comfortable and began to
read the book he had laid aside on the previous day.
But as time went on he put it down and endeavored
to attract the trader’s attention by making significant
signs and gestures, such as filling an invisible vessel
from an imaginary bottle, lifting his hand to his
mouth and going through the motions of drinking
with evident gusto, and swallowing an indefinite
quantity of something with an appreciative smack
of the lips. These pantomimic efforts failing, he
coughed spasmodically, then uttered sundry vague
half sentences, among which “An eye-opener,”
“Throat as dry as a lime-kiln,” “A hair of the dog
that bites you,” could be plainly distinguished, and
all these attempts at effecting a “liquor up” being
abortive, he came abruptly to the point with a hint
there was no mistaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about a drink?” he asked with an ingratiating
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the trader was gazing out through the window,
his thoughts far away, and Broom was obliged
to repeat his words with emphasis before Thursby
became aware that he was speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, “Eh!” he ejaculated, turning sharply and
collecting his errant thoughts with an effort. “I beg
pardon, Broom. I was thinking, and your words
passed over me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was merely inquiring whether there was
a ‘shot left in the locker,’” grumbled Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other laughed, paused irresolutely, then set
a bottle and enamelled mug on the table. Broom
eyed these proceedings with manifest satisfaction.
But perceiving there was but one mug he raised his
eyebrows and glanced significantly from the mug
to Roy and back to the mug again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy shook his head and smiled. “No,” he said,
“it’s too early.” He waited until Broom had helped
himself, then again placed the bottle under lock and
key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom shrugged his shoulders at this caution. He
screwed his face into an extravagant expression of
dismay, then, changing his expression suddenly, he
emptied the mug at a gulp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Buttoning his coat and drawing his cap well down,
Roy went out to take another look for the packet.
Broom followed Roy to the door with his eyes, then
took up the mug and looked into it as if to see
whether by any possible chance a drop had been left
in the bottom. Raising it to his lips, he drained the
few remaining drops, then finding he could squeeze
no more out of it, replaced the mug and settled himself
to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Sahanderry, trying to appear at ease,
was in the kitchen preparing dinner. He broke off
short in a song to glance at Ocpic who was squatting
in a corner, watching him from beneath lowered
brows. Mustering courage, Sahanderry again burst
forth, but only managed two lines before his courage
again failed him. His song stopped abruptly; he
wiped the perspiration from his forehead with a
hand that trembled; his eyes rolled in their sockets,
and his hair stood on end more than usual. Then
he laughed the short mirthless laugh of a man who
was afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this juncture the door opened and Delgezie appeared,
accompanied by Minnihak, and Sahanderry’s
face brightened instantly. He greeted the newcomers
with effusion. Feeling that he had a sympathetic
confidant in Delgezie, he related the story
of the stolen key. But the old man evidently was
made of “sterner stuff.” He listened to the tale with
the keenest attention and at first looked puzzled, then
astonished, then fierce and wrathful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story was no sooner finished than Delgezie
called Minnihak to him and, despite Sahanderry’s
protests, and his own limited knowledge of the Eskimo
language, he acquainted him with what had
occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnihak nodded twice after the old man had
finished speaking, as if to let him know that he perfectly
understood, then, walking across the kitchen,
he squatted down a few feet in front of Ocpic and
sat gazing fixedly at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic, no whit abashed, returned the look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some moments of silence, “You’re a thief!”
said Minnihak sharply, and there was a prolonged
wait. The two Eskimo glared fiercely at each other,
Ocpic’s breath came quickly, and his eyes glittered
evilly. At length he got slowly to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other did likewise and, standing silently, the
two men continued their fixed stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Ocpic deliberately threw off his coat
and shirt and again Minnihak leisurely followed suit.
Then, still in perfect silence, they straightened themselves,
and, standing naked to the waist, prepared for
a pugilistic encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stationing themselves at arm’s length the belligerents
stood firm, and Ocpic, considering himself the
better man, allowed his opponent the first blow and
placed himself in the required position to receive it.
With left arm drawn tight against his side and the
shoulder pushed well forward, he stood offering the
other a fair opportunity to strike his exposed biceps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnihak paused a moment, as if mustering his
strength, then, with a swinging blow, he struck. The
blow was received with a grim smile, and the arm
fell into its natural position, proclaiming the recipient
ready to take his revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drawing himself up, Minnihak then offered the
muscles of his arm for sacrifice. Ocpic brought his
fist round with a wicked swing and struck a mighty
blow. Minnihak winced visibly. Ocpic smiled
grimly and drew back into position again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was now a few minutes interval of quiet,
during which Broom entered the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! You giddy gamecocks,” he cried, “What’s
the row?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie hastened to explain and the sailor seated
himself to enjoy the fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a novel scene. The daylight straggled
through the frosted windows and lit the room dimly.
The combatants breathed heavily. Delgezie leaned
against the table with an anxious look on his bronzed
face. He was feeling a little apprehensive for Minnihak’s
safety. Sahanderry clung to the old man in
abject terror. He was viewing an Eskimo fight for
the first time and the heavy, resounding blows appeared
fearfully blood-thirsty compared to the milder
hair-pulling battles of his own race. Broom sat smiling
and contemptuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pugilists again took positions and more hard
blows were given and received. These proceedings
were repeated several times. Ocpic accepted his punishment
carelessly, but Minnihak was showing signs
of fatigue. He was clearly getting the worst of it.
After a few more exchanges upon the arms, Ocpic
threw his head to one side, offering his cheek for a
mark, and the other drew himself together and made
laudable efforts to gain the victory, but his blow
lacked force, and all felt that the fight was over when
it became Ocpic’s turn to strike. Their fears were
well grounded. Ocpic struck his opponent low down
upon the jaw. The blow had a touch of the uppercut,
and Minnihak staggered and fell to the floor, where
he lay for a few moments blinking confusedly. Then
he slowly got to his feet. Ocpic stood watching him
closely, but Minnihak had evidently had enough. He
crossed over to where his clothes were lying and
started to pull on his shirt. This was the act of a
vanquished man. Ocpic smiled exultantly at each
of the spectators in turn, then followed the example
of his opponent. Their toilets completed, the two
Eskimos squatted on the floor close together and filled
their pipes from the victor’s fire-bag as if nothing
unusual had happened.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>LOST IN THE DRIFTING SNOW.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>While the incorrigible Mr. Broom was sitting on
his bunk making prodigious efforts at harmony,
David and Kasba were preparing to fetch the deer
that had fallen to the boy’s gun on the previous day.
The sled was brought to the door and packed with
sundry cooking utensils, and, this completed, David
drew the wrapper together and lashed it with a clapmatch
line, tucking his rifle and axe under the lashing
at the top of the load to be handy in case of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Kasba caught and harnessed the dogs,
and everything being ready, she started off at a quick
walk. Barking joyfully, the dogs bounded after,
while David sat astride the loaded sled, laughing and
jubilant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mile after mile was accomplished in this manner
till the sun peeped over the horizon, and Kasba, bethinking
herself of breakfast, slackened her pace,
keeping a wary eye for a suitable place for a halt.
After journeying a short distance she came to a place
where there were sufficient spruce trees and enough
dry wood for their purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stepping suddenly, she turned and called to the
dogs, who required no encouragement to increase
their efforts. The girl’s act was significant: they
knew exactly what was about to happen. With lolling
tongues and panting breath they reached the girl and
threw themselves down to snatch the few minutes’
rest which they knew would be allowed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David dropped from the sled to his feet, took his
axe and attacked a few dead spruce trees while Kasba,
obedient to Indian custom, made a fire and put a
kettle on the burning embers. Contrary to the old
proverb that “a watched pot never boils,” the water
in this kettle was soon bubbling, and the two young
people sank upon the brush which David had strewn
beside the fire, eating their scanty breakfast with
eager relish. The meal did not occupy many minutes,
however, and they were soon on their way again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning was bright, and the cold acted as a
stimulant on the two. Kasba walked quickly over
the snow with easy, buoyant steps, gazing on the
monotonous scene with eager eyes. The branches of
the spruce had taken unto themselves a covering of
white, sparkling crystals which easily outvied in
beauty the trees’ natural verdure. Large flocks of
willow partridges ran about on the smooth white
crust or delved into the snow, occasionally disappearing
into the thickest part of the scrub for safety
when a partridge-hawk hovered ominously over them.
The sky was blue and cloudless save for a few white
fleeces floating low down upon the horizon. The air
was clear and still. A cut track led through the
thicker part of the scrub to a lake two or three miles
in width. Half way across this icebound lake the
dogs espied a number of deer grouped together, not
far to the right, watching their progress; with a
lightning-like movement the leader diverged from the
straight course and made toward the deer, which,
perceiving no danger, were now calmly approaching
the objects of their curiosity. But after drawing
quite close they made a sudden retrograde movement,
then ran around in circles. At intervals they stopped
in their course to scrutinize the dogs anew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the dogs started on their wild rush after the
deer, Kasba joined David in dragging on the head-line,
but even the combined efforts of the two had
no effect in staying them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scenting danger, the deer soon made off at a long,
easy trot with the dogs in wild pursuit, until the
sled’s coming in contact with a large block of ice
threw Kasba forward, and she was dragged rapidly
onward until, her arms growing tired, the line slipped
from her grasp and the dogtrain quickly shot ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gathering herself up the girl stood looking after
the disappearing sled with a rueful countenance and
combined <a id='feel'></a>feelings of mortification and disgust at her
ignominious position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile David was speeding over the ice in a
manner calculated to break his neck, but a momentary
delay occasioned by the sled colliding with the
stump of a tree on the farther side of the lake gave
him an opportunity to regain control of the dogs,
which he halted, and then waited for Kasba to come
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the discomfited girl at length reached them
David gazed at her mutely for a moment, then the
woeful expression on her face somehow tickled the
boy’s sense of humor and he burst into <a id='into'></a>a fit of loud
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sudden change from extreme gravity to boisterous
gaiety startled Kasba, who stood for a moment
irresolute, then threw herself beside him on the sled,
laughing hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, as David’s wandering gaze became fixed
upon the sky, his gaiety ceased as suddenly as it had
begun, and he sat staring at the threatening storm-clouds
which were silently creeping upward. Then,
jumping hastily off the sled, he “drove up” his dogs
with all vigor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba, shivering, drew the hood of her coat, which
had slipped back during her frantic slide on the lake,
upon her head with a quick pull, for a keen and cutting
wind was rising, and started off at a quick trot
in the direction pointed out by her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon a large, dark heap, marked by a fluttering
handkerchief tied to a stick, came into view. The
girl divined that it was the object of their journey
and ran straight toward it. As she approached a
number of small white animals stood about it barking
shrilly. They were the white foxes of the North,
and appeared about to defend their position, but a
nearer approach disconcerted them and they scuttled
off to a safe distance, where they sat watching events.
Not all, however, for David had set steel traps around
the deer the day before, and a few foxes were caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather now looked ominous, and no time was
lost in loading the sled with meat. The train was
then turned toward home, and Kasba started back
against the wind with a resolute look on her small
brown face. David urged the dogs along with loud
cracks of the whip, for the wind had risen and was
now rushing across the plain in a biting blast, while
large dark clouds, which had suddenly appeared upon
the horizon, spread rapidly over the sky like huge
phantoms, extinguishing the sun in a veil of vapor.
David adjured Kasba to make all speed and “drove
up” his dogs with renewed energy. Hurrying on,
they stopped for nothing, till presently the “little
hill,” which meant home, could be dimly seen in the
distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl breathed a sigh of relief, for she realized
that the Fort was only a few miles beyond the hill.
But her comfort was short-lived. The wind, as if
regretting its previous leniency toward them, now
burst into a hurricane, and all sounds were drowned
by its howlings, while the whirlwinds of snow which
it raised filled the air and completely obscured objects
a few yards distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the storm cast its cutting ice-dust against
David’s face, he could not even see the dogs. He
halted them and shouted loudly for Kasba to come
back, then fired his rifle several times. He waited
five minutes, ten minutes, but the moments passed
and the girl did not appear. He walked forward as
far as he dared, but returned immediately, for he
could not see two paces from him and the drifting
snow obliterated every footmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David paused irresolutely. He hated to proceed
without Kasba, yet he felt that to remain would be
a useless sacrifice, for he was utterly helpless in such
a blizzard. Besides, Kasba was walking in the right
direction when last he saw her, and she might possibly
stumble upon the Fort. It would be a miracle, he
knew, but miracles did sometimes happen. Thus
buoying up his hopes for Kasba’s safety, he determined
to trust to the sagacity of the dogs to take him
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dogs were now lying down and showed a
decided objection to the biting wind and drifting
snow. Finding his efforts to make them draw the
loaded sled of no avail, he hastily threw off the meat,
and again endeavored to start them. Presently an
idea of what their driver required seemed to dawn
upon the dogs, and, their speed accelerated by a few
sharp cuts of the whip, they started off so suddenly
that they left David standing where he was; and it
was only with the utmost difficulty that he caught
them up and threw himself on the empty sled, where
he lay prone upon his face, burying his head in the
heavy sled wrapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If David’s condition was precarious, Kasba’s at the
same time was even more perilous. Had she remained
where she was when the hurricane burst upon them
the dogs would have overtaken her, for they soon
passed the spot on their way to the Fort. But, in her
trepidation, she had endeavored to return to David,
and this proved her undoing. The clouds of whirling
snow thickened as she scudded along, a mere play-thing
for the wind. Then suddenly there was a
muffled shout and the girl turned quickly in the
direction of the sound, and endeavored to reach the
spot from whence it came. But the wind caught her
again, driving her before it until she had totally lost
any vague idea she had previously entertained concerning
her position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding this, she persevered. She walked
till she was well assured that she had lost David in
the drifting snow, then she turned, and made prodigious
efforts to reach a place of shelter. By keeping
the wind in her face, she felt that she was going in
the right direction, but thick clouds of snow struck
her at close intervals and prevented her from seeing
a yard before her, while the force of the wind was
such that it was almost impossible at times for her
to stand upright against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To dream of reaching the Fort in such weather
was simply madness, and the poor girl had no choice
but to proceed at random with the slender hope of
finding some shelter from the strength of the blizzard,
and soon she felt that nothing short of a miracle
could save her, and staggered forward with a prayer
on her lips. But the thought of her poor old father’s
terrible grief should she perish in the cold, forced her
onward and kept her weary legs from sinking beneath
her. With the heroism of a martyr the girl endeavored
to do for his sake what, as she felt, she had
neither the will nor the strength to accomplish for
her own, and she stood for a moment in dull despair,
worn out by cold, fatigue and hunger, for she had
eaten nothing since their hasty breakfast early that
morning. Nature called to her loudly to discontinue
her arduous efforts and sink down upon the snow,
but distracted though the girl was, she fully understood
that should she succumb to the languor she was
feeling, a little white mound would soon mark her
last resting-place. Filial affection was strong within
her, and with superhuman efforts she staggered forward.
After half-an-hour’s desperate struggle with
the hurricane—half an hour which to her appeared
like a century—the girl stumbled and fell. She
quickly recovered herself but had not proceeded many
steps before she fell again. This time the fall well-nigh
deprived her of the little energy now left her,
and it was with great difficulty that she regained her
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she endeavored to shake off the numbing effects
of the intense cold, she looked around her, gradually,
carefully, and then for the first time she perceived
that she was getting among rocks, and that it was
the outlying boulders of these that had caused her to
fall. Presently a ridge of rocks loomed through the
drifting snow, seen during a lull in the gusts. This
presented a welcome protection from the wind’s icy
blast, and uttering the glad cry of one suddenly rescued
from what had appeared almost certain death,
the girl staggered forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the hurricane, as if angered at losing its lawful
prey, seemed to rush upon her with greater force
than ever. It almost dragged her away in its powerful
grasp. Aroused by the imminence of the danger,
Kasba made strenuous efforts to reach a projecting
rock, which stood up heroically to the furious tempest,
offering its protection to the distressed girl.
With a cry of relief she sank under its shelter. She
was still in a most unenviable position, however, and
was not slow to realize it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After resting some moments, Kasba applied herself
to prayer. In a few broken sentences she conveyed
her thanks to God for His infinite mercy in
rescuing her from the drifting snow. Then feeling
assured that she had not been saved from the hurricane
to perish miserably from cold and hunger, she
turned her thoughts to the means of effecting her
further escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gazing around she tried to discover her whereabouts.
A close scrutiny of the rock that sheltered
her proved it to be a well-known landmark, and this
sufficed to tell her that she was in a gully not far from
the Fort. With this comforting assurance she proceeded
to keep herself as warm as she might. Breaking
some branches with much difficulty from a spruce
tree that grew near-by, she laid them at the bottom of
a hole in the rock. Then going out upon the plain
she stood her snowshoes upright as a sign of her close
proximity in case the worst befel and search was
made for her body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning to her haven of safety, Kasba drew off
her hairy-coat, and, tying a handkerchief over her
head, crouched in the hollow, drawing the coat over
her in the manner of a blanket. Then she waited
with a fortitude worthy of the sterner sex for the end
of the hurricane; for she knew relief from the Fort
was hardly possible till then.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>“THE PACKET” AT LAST.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning of the day on which Kasba and
David were lost in the blizzard, Roy Thursby stood
on a high ridge of rocks at the back of the Fort, gazing
through a telescope at a minute speck in the
distance. Was it his imagination, or did the object
move? He gazed eagerly at it until his sight became
blurred, and he was forced to drop the glass and give
his eyes a rest. However, after a few minutes spent
in excitedly wiping the lens of the telescope, he again
applied it to his eye. Yes, the object did move, but—was
he sure? Again he gazed long and earnestly,
his feelings undergoing curious changes as they wavered
between certainty and doubt. Then the object
of his attention suddenly made a slight detour which
was unmistakable. Roy uttered a wild whoop, shut
the telescope with a snap and went scrambling down
the rocks with the enthusiasm of a delighted school-boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before he reached the Fort he fell to shouting,
joyfully:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sahanderry! Sahanderry! Up with the flag!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kitchen door opened and Broom’s face appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the fire?” he enquired with a well-feigned
look of terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire be hanged! It’s the ‘packet,’” cried Roy
exultantly, and in a lumbering fashion he cut a boyish
caper on the loose snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not to be outdone, Broom stepped from the doorway
and began a grotesque performance which he
called the Highland fling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out of it,” cried Roy, giving him a push.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom paused with a leg poised gracefully in the
air. “You’re an unappreciative, cold-blooded Englishman,”
he exclaimed in an injured tone. “Why,
I’m thinking of you, not of myself. I’m dancing
with delight, my boy, sheer delight. You’ll now be
satiated with ‘billy doos,’” and he performed a few
more intricate steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop your nonsense, man!” commanded Roy,
while he laughed heartily at the man’s antics. “But
put on your coat and come out on the rocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom instantly stopped his piroueting, to disappear
into the house and return shortly, struggling
into his coat as he came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my bold Sir Launcelot, my lovesick swain,
we will proceed to watch the approach of Cupid’s
errant messenger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this he attempted to link his arm in Roy’s,
who promptly gave him a push which wellnigh precipitated
him into an adjacent snowdrift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chatting merrily, the two men climbed the rocks
till they arrived at the summit, where they stood gazing
over the dazzling whiteness at the blot, which
could easily be distinguished with the naked eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of dogs, scenting excitement, scampered
about on top of the ridge of rocks, startling the <span class='it'>kas-i-ba</span>
(rock partridges), which flew up in flocks of
great size. Near at hand Delgezie and Sahanderry
scrambled up the eminence, while below Ocpic and
Minnihak, accompanied by more dogs, were making
prodigious efforts to join them. The flagstaff cut the
sky-line sharply, and the flag, which had now been
run up, fluttered merrily as if it, too, desired to welcome
the weary “packet-men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within half-an-hour of their undignified scramble
up the rocks they were precipitating themselves down
again to welcome the arrivals, who were now close
at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only by the persistent efforts of the dog-driver
and his companion that the “packet” sled
was drawn to the summit of the snowdrift in front
of the Fort, for the dogs were completely worn out.
They staggered along, making heroic attempts to appear
to the best advantage before strangers, but
appearances were against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, George Hopkins,” said Roy, extending his
hand, “I’m glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’re right glad to get here, sir,” answered
Hopkins, drily. “The trip’s been a hard one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose it has,” returned the trader with
an approving glance at the plucky little half-breed
who had accomplished the long, arduous journey.
But Hopkins appeared to look on the trip as nothing
exceptionally hazardous; it was just a part of the
work that his contract with the Hudson’s Bay Company
called for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopkins’ Eskimo companion, Poo-koo, next received
Roy’s attention, and just then Broom, who
had been standing idly by, uttered a terrific yell as
the dog-driver lifted the packet-box from under the
sled wrapper. The package was a small and unimposing
spectacle, covered with canvas; an insignificant
object, indeed, to be carried such a number of
miles at so great an expenditure of money and labor;
but the importance of its contents and mission made
up for its otherwise commonplace appearance, and
such evidently was Hopkins’ opinion, for he handled
the box carefully and with great respect for its “honorable
enclosures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy turned sharply on his heel at the sailor’s shout,
and, perceiving what Hopkins had in his hand, he
walked forward to take charge of it with as much
unconcern as his excited state permitted him to
assume. He was feeling a little piqued at the noise
Broom was making. It was, he felt, a continuance
of the ridicule he had provoked that morning, and he
resented Broom’s pertinacious buffoonery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom was watching Roy with considerable curiosity,
for the occasion suggested to him the possibility
of a celebration. But the Englishman’s manner was
disappointing. In common with most of his countrymen,
he thought it a weakness to give unlimited sway
to his finer emotions, and generally covered them
with an appearance of coldness and reserve. He did
so in this instance, and Broom’s hopes fell to zero.
But the expected happened, for when Roy and
Hopkins started for the house, the former suggested
that George should “take a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suggestion was received by George with unconcealed
satisfaction, and Broom, who was following
them closely, smiled in silent approbation of a
proposal which was so entirely in accord with his
own mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a dirty day,” remarked Roy,
glancing at the threatening clouds which hovered on
the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s going to blow from the north-west,”
prophesied the dog-driver. “We’ve just got here in
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you’re lucky. It will drift like the very
dickens with all this loose snow about,” supplemented
the trader, who now paused to look around; then,
“But come,” he added, “let’s get indoors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With steps few and rapid the men soon reached the
house. As they entered the door Sahanderry was
observed standing with a steaming kettle in his hand.
He spoke hurriedly to Hopkins, who hesitated a
moment, then detained the trader with a respectful
touch on the arm, and requested permission to postpone
the whiskey-drinking till he had partaken of a
few cups of tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tea!” ejaculated the surprised trader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom was vastly amazed; that any man in the
possession of his senses should prefer this homely
beverage to the more exhilarating spirit was entirely
beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” observed George in respectful tones of
apology, “I haven’t drunk tea for eight days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy’s face cleared. “Of course,” he said, “you’ve
been without wood to boil the kettle. Where did you
get the last cup of tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Cape Eskimo,” replied the other, mentioning
a point some two hundred miles south of Fort Future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you haven’t tasted tea since; poor devil!”
Roy now exhorted Sahanderry to at once supply the
packet man with what he desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Indian had a comprehensive knowledge of
“tripping,” and had already brewed a kettle of tea.
He now offered Hopkins a large mugful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s capital, Sahanderry,” cried Roy, and
he bade George seat himself and eat and drink to his
heart’s content. “You’ve earned it,” he declared.
“You can come to me later for the whiskey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the “packet” under his arm Roy entered his
<span class='it'>sanctum sanctorum</span>, closely followed by Broom, whose
face displayed the resentment he was feeling at what
he considered Hopkins’ idiosyncrasy in preferring
tea to whiskey. He considered Hopkins had thrown
away a glorious opportunity, and expressed his irritation
in sullen looks and dissatisfied demeanor. “Of
all the lunatics,” he murmured to himself, glaring
back at the unconscious cause of his anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader opened the “packet” without any unseemly
haste, for he felt the other’s eyes upon him.
There were a goodly number of letters and newspapers.
These he commenced to sort, but, feeling
that Broom was watching his every movement, he
suddenly stopped, caught up a handful of newspapers
at random and handed them to his too watchful companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom took the newspapers awkwardly and murmured
something, presumably his thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Roy turned to his correspondence. He hummed
an Eskimo Crane song as he separated the letters
from the papers.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>which song, the natives solemnly aver, is sung by
those birds on all occasions of festivity, the birds
sitting round in a ring with one bird, presumably the
leader, standing in the centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy hummed it over several times before completing
his task. A small, square package of cardboard
containing a photograph seemed to cause him much
hesitation, and he paused to lay it beside the letters,
then again to take it up and lay it on the newspapers,
but eventually he gave it a place of honor by itself,
apart from the rest of the mail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time the last letter was sorted the heap had
grown to a respectable size. This fact Roy comprehended
with manifest satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letters were addressed to him in several different
hands, but the greater number were in the hand-writing
of one person—evidently that of a lady.
After these letters had been separated from the others
he arranged them according to a mystic sign, or
number, which was visible in the left hand corner of
each envelope, then suddenly, without any apparent
cause, he dropped them on the table to snatch up the
cardboard package. Cutting the string that bound it
together, he discovered a photograph of a young girl,
or rather, young woman, for it was the picture of a
person about twenty years of age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The photograph was of the size known as a
“cabinet.” The lady’s costume, what could be perceived
of it, was shadowy and indistinct. The features
were those of a young, healthy-looking maiden
neither beautiful nor even pretty, but the expression
of the girl’s face was pleasant, and the eyes which
looked fearlessly out from it were large and good. The
figure as far as could be judged from the photograph
was short, and, to use a vulgar expression which aptly
describes it, stocky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy held the photo tenderly, gazing rapturously at
the face pictured there. Presently he withdrew his
eyes and glanced cautiously across at his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom’s face was hidden by the newspaper, in the
reading of which he was apparently absorbed. Taking
advantage of the other’s abstraction, Roy hastily
pressed the photograph to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crisp, crackling sound peculiar to paper brought
a blush to Roy’s cheek, and with guilty haste he laid
the cardboard on the table, then he looked up with
what nonchalance he could muster. His companion’s
attention was still absorbed in his reading, and Roy
concluded with a feeling of relief that his late proceedings
had passed unobserved. For although the
act of kissing a photograph was in no way a grave
offence, yet it was not an act he cared to commit before
witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roy was wrong in his conjectures. By a skilful
manipulation of the newspaper, Broom had seen
Roy’s every act, and now sat behind the paper with
a supercilious smile upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opening the first letter, Roy scanned it eagerly.
“Well, my dear boy,” it ran, “you will be pleased to
hear that Papa has at last received his commission
as Inspecting Chief Factor. The letter that he received
from the directors in London acquainting him
with the appointment was eulogistic in the extreme.
The following extracts will give you some idea of the
nice things they said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a satisfaction to know that you are
still in the sphere of activity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We all
feel that in you we shall have an Inspecting
Chief Factor who will exercise his influence
to instil new life into the Company which
needs just now a master mind to resuscitate—to
some extent, at least—its ancient prestige
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That you will set yourself to work
to inaugurate changes which are much
needed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now, what do you think of that? And
dare you aspire to the daughter of such a man? But
I have kept my greatest bit of news until the last.
Papa is so elated with his new commission, and determined
to inaugurate the changes spoken of in the
letter, that he has decided to make a long trip of
inspection during the coming summer, and, prepare
to be astonished, ‘Fort Future’ is to be visited.
Think of that, my boy, and tremble.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Roy read this letter through twice before laying it
down to take up another, which was written in a
different key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A terrible calamity has happened here. Young
Mr. College got into a quarrel with a native and shot
him dead. Papa declares that he was quite justified,
as it was in self-defence, but I think it was horrible.
I shall never look on the young fellow without a
shudder. It would be impossible for me to take his
hand; in my imagination it is covered with blood.
<span class='it'>For in my opinion it is murder for a man to take
another man’s life, no matter what the circumstances
that seem to extenuate it.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For perhaps five minutes Roy pondered over this
letter and when he laid it down it was with a very
solemn face. The words stirred him strangely, and
he sat absent-mindedly fingering the next letter for
some moments before cutting the envelope, but when
he did so and his eye caught the opening lines, he
started erect in his seat and a slight exclamation of
surprise escaped him. Broom glanced at him inquiringly,
but Roy was absorbed in his occupation
and quite oblivious of Broom’s presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy,” the letter ran, “you must not be
frightened when I tell you that I have been ill. Not
seriously ill, dear, but what we Canadians call ‘under
the weather,’ and papa, after eager solicitations from
myself, has promised to allow me to accompany him
on his visit to Fort Future. Is not that most beautiful?
I am sure I shall never get another good night’s
sleep till the time comes for us to start. It is three
years since we saw each other. I wonder if I shall
find you changed in appearance? If you will think
that I have grown old-looking or ugly? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You
may rest assured that, if I am alive and well, at the
earliest possible chance after open navigation you
will have the life plagued out of you by</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Your ever loving</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Lena</span>.”</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>This being the last letter necessary to the construction
of our romance, we will leave Roy Thursby to
his letters while I digress in my story to say something
about the writer of the billet doux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first few years of Roy Thursby’s employment
in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s service were spent
in the Mackenzie River District. The officer in charge
of the Fort at which Roy was stationed was Factor
James McLeod, a widower with one child, Lena—Roy’s
fair correspondent. After a short time spent
in the constant society of the Factor’s daughter the
young clerk became enamored of her and she in
return favored his aspirations. Perceiving the upright
character of the young fellow and the zeal he
displayed in the Company’s service—which augured
well for his future success—Mr. McLeod consented
to their being engaged, but stipulated that Roy should
be in the possession of his Chief Trader’s commission
before they entertained any thoughts of marriage.
Then Roy had been transferred to York Factory, and
from there to Fort Future, as we have seen.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>DELGEZIE’S DESPAIR.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Roy Thursby laid down the last of his correspondence
with mixed feelings of pleasure and strange
forebodings. The delight he was feeling, since learning
that Lena McLeod was to accompany her father
on his trip of inspection, was tempered in a large
measure by the words contained in the letter announcing
young College’s fatal encounter with the
Indian—“For in my opinion it is murder for a man
to take another man’s life no matter what the circumstances
that seem to extenuate it.” This was a
strange decree from one so young, and the words rang
in Roy’s brain, try how he might to forget them.
Yet why they should so disturb and influence him
he could not for the life of him imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mechanically he caught up a newspaper and ran
his eye over its pages till dinner was pronounced
ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the meal Broom’s manner appeared sullen
and taciturn, and after a few minutes of desultory
talk Roy lapsed into silence. But when they rose
from the table the trader appeared to suddenly guess
the cause of the other’s moodiness, for after gaily
exhorting Hopkins to come forward, he brought forth
the “comfort,” and at this Broom’s face immediately
cleared, while Hopkins entered the room blithely and
took the stiff dram offered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrival of the “packet” was now celebrated
by Broom with more fervor, and entirely unsolicited
he refilled his glass and drank success to “George
Hopkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy noted the circumstance with displeasure, but
suppressed his inclination to draw Broom’s attention
to it, and drank the toast with as much grace
as he could assume. Then, unceremoniously, he
whipped the bottle off the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No whit abashed, the loquacious Broom told a
number of pithy stories, which he related in his inimitable
manner. These and other merry quips kept
Hopkins in a constant fit of laughter, in which Roy,
despite his annoyance, was at length forced to join.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a gust of wind struck the house, shaking
it to its foundations. The trader and the dog-driver
glanced simultaneously at the window, then at each
other with an accompanying nod, as if to say that
their prognostications of a blow were proving correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once Roy thought of Kasba, for he had been
told that she had gone for meat. Had she returned?
Had anyone seen her pass the house? Where was
her father, Delgezie?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Receiving no answer to his questions from Broom
or Hopkins, neither of whom knew the whereabouts
of the girl or her father, Roy called in Sahanderry
and again put the questions. The Indian entered
with a face that clearly betrayed the anxiety he was
feeling, but he could give no satisfactory information.
He was almost certain Kasba had not returned, but
as it was possible that she might have passed while
they were at dinner he was unable to speak positively.
He then spoke of his own doubts and fears regarding
the girl’s safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the trader checked these voluble premonitions
by commanding Sahanderry to go to Delgezie’s hut
and find out the truth of the matter, while he struggled
into his “hairy coat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without waiting for further directions the Indian
rushed from the room. Fears for Kasba’s safety
animated his movements. But he was stopped short
in his impetuous haste before he had crossed the
kitchen, the door being suddenly thrown open by
Delgezie himself, who hastily entered, pulling the
door to after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie’s entrance was the signal for the greatly
perturbed Sahanderry to begin a string of confusing
questions interlarded with much advice and dire
prophecies of evil, but Roy came to the rescue of the
distracted old man by peremptorily ordering the
young Indian to hold his tongue, and then by a few
direct questions the trader elicited the fact that the
girl and boy left the Fort at seven o’clock that morning
and had not yet returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven o’clock! They had left at seven o’clock!
Then they should have been back long ago! It is now
two! What can have happened to them?” The trader
spoke sharply and with evident anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a bewildered fashion the old Indian stood gazing
at the speaker, leaning a little forward as if to
better read the expression on Roy’s face. He had
the most implicit faith in the trader’s superior judgment,
and with the simplicity of a child waited to be
told what he was to do. His features worked in a
nervous, agitated manner and a pipe that he had been
unconsciously holding fell from his hand to the floor.
Suddenly he seemed to be aware of Roy’s perturbed
manner, and made for the door, but at once Roy called
after him, demanding what he was about to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man made no answer. He was fumbling
at the door, which he presently opened and went
hastily out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those left in the room looked askance at one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow him, Sahanderry,” cried Roy; “bring
him back; he cannot go like that. Be quick, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry hastened to the door, but a sharp cry
without caused him to pause with his hand on the
latch. The cry was followed by the howling of dogs;
a peculiar long-drawn howl which the listener instantly
recognized as proceeding from dogs that had
become entangled or whose progress was in some
measure impeded. The trio in the inner room again
looked at one another, but this time it was with a
smile of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s them,” asserted Sahanderry from the
kitchen, “the dogs have found their way home and
the sled has got stuck against something.” With this
information he hurried outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he opened the door and stepped out,
Sahanderry could see nothing; everything was obscured
by the drifting snow. The wind rushed round
the buildings from all points at once and seemed to
gather additional impetus at every corner. The Indian
paused, half blinded by the cutting wind and
nipped by the intense cold. But the dogs, as if to
baffle discovery and thereby prolong his apprehensions,
became suddenly quiet. Taking a step forward
he called to them in a loud voice. Just then a bulky
object loomed suddenly out of the gloom and he came
in violent contact with something which, although
sufficiently substantial to cause him a shock and
nearly send him off his feet, was at the same time
curiously soft. Sahanderry recoiled from it with a
thrill of apprehension and the thing, whatever it was,
instantly passed into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dazed and vastly astonished Indian remained
for a moment staring after the object. Then an idea
of what it was struck him and he swiftly followed it.
When he entered the house he found Roy Thursby
bending over something which lay stretched upon a
table, over which a blanket had been thrown. Delgezie
was standing apart, nervous yet confident in his
master’s power to restore animation to the apparently
lifeless body he had just given into his charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After bending over the object for a moment longer,
Roy looked up with a slight exclamation and a quick
glance at Delgezie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man’s quiet demeanor led Roy to suppose
that he was laboring under the delusion that the
body was that of Kasba. The mistake was very possible,
for the object was enveloped in a “hairy coat,”
and was covered with snow when Delgezie discovered
it. He had evidently caught it from the sled without
closely inspecting it and rushed into the house with
the senseless David in the belief that it was Kasba
he was carrying. Roy was debating how best to
acquaint Delgezie with the error when the matter
was taken entirely out of his hands by Sahanderry,
who had drawn nigh and was now hurling a volley
of questions at the unconscious boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie started as if electrified when the import
of Sahanderry’s importunate questions dawned upon
him. He glanced suspiciously around as if to perceive
whether by any possibility the body could have
been changed, then rushed to the table, where he
gazed long and searchingly at David, whose existence
he had evidently forgotten in his great despair for
Kasba. Then wildly he turned, and, holding up his
hands, cried in accents of direst agony: “She is my
all, O God! Take not the tender branch and leave
the old trunk standing!” Then, dropping his hands,
he added as if to himself, “But I will find her or
never return alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uttering these words, he was again about to rush
from the room when Roy caught his arm and so prevented
him. With the fury of a wild animal the old
man turned on his captor; then, perceiving whom he
was struggling with, he instantly desisted. The
trader, however, held him for a moment longer in
order to allow time for his habit of discipline to
assert itself, then commanded him, with a harshness
he was far from feeling, to seat himself and so remain
until he was told to move. The poor old man
seated himself mechanically with bowed head and
dazed, resigned manner pitiful to witness. The
sight of the Indian’s profound despair went to the
heart of the trader, who had a singular affection for
the aged; but the moment was too pregnant of danger
both to the boy on the table and the girl out in the
drifting snow to allow him to engage in sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Broom with commendable dexterity
had removed all of David’s clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snow! Bring snow!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry and the little dog-driver, who had been
present during these proceedings, quickly fetched the
required snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unfortunate boy’s hands and face were literally
frozen. His eyes were closed, and his lips
pressed tightly together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom and Hopkins now gave the boy a vigorous
rubbing with snow to restore the circulation, which
had been arrested by the intense cold. This was no
soft, agreeable massage, but a lustily performed rubbing
that almost took the skin off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time these exhausting efforts had the desired
effect. David sighed and opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon the garrulous Sahanderry again bombarded
him with questions, but a peremptory: “Be
quiet and fetch me some hot water,” from the trader,
sent him post-haste to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily diluting some brandy, Roy, after a little
difficulty, got it down the boy’s throat and almost
immediately he seemed much revived. The light
expression returned to his eyes, and he tried to articulate,
and the trader began to hope that he might
have an explanation before he left on his search for
the missing girl; and while the boy had been undergoing
his severe course of friction Roy had been by
no means idle, as two neatly rolled bundles enveloped
in blankets testified. He had tied up what necessaries
he judged likely to prove useful to the distressed
Kasba, making them into two bundles, each
ready to sling across a man’s shoulder. He intended
to carry one himself and give the other to Delgezie
to carry; thereby guarding against any possibility of
either of them coming upon the girl without the recuperating
necessaries; for in their hazardous hunt
for the missing girl the two men might become separated.
Then, bending over the prostrate boy, Roy
earnestly adjured him to tell where he had last seen
Kasba.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David’s attempts to articulate were pitiful to behold;
the name of the girl he loved as a sister stimulated
him to heroic efforts to speak, but he could only
moan in reply, while large tears ran down his burning
cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy soon perceived that he would be unable to get
an explanation from the boy in the usual way, and
resolved to acquire the desired information by the
intricate means of signs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he bent over David and this time he spoke in
Chipewyan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, David,” he said, speaking slowly, “I see
that you are unable to talk, but you can hear me speak
and by doing what I desire, you will make yourself
understood just as well. If you wish to answer ‘yes’
close both your eyes, if ‘no’ keep them open. You
understand me, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s bright eyes shut instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right!” said Roy. “Now, was Kasba
walking ‘before’ the dogs when you last saw her?”
Those bright eyes shut again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! You were coming to the Fort and were
somewhere near the ‘little hill’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s eyes closed quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were on this side of the ‘hill’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David stared at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were on the other side?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David shut his eyes in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Roy hesitated, then, as if deciding
he could not get any further information, he turned
to go. But as he did so he saw such a look of profound
despair pass over David’s face that he turned
to him again. The mute appeal in the boy’s eyes
gripped at his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want me to search in some particular place
for Kasba?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes shut instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the ‘saw pit’?” David stared at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sandy Ridge?” There was no response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy mentioned all the likely localities by name,
but those haunting eyes only watched him feverishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tenderly he patted the boy’s head. “You have
done your best, David,” Roy said, “but it is impossible
for me to understand where you mean and I
must go and look for the girl without further delay.”
With this he turned away. But David, after lying
perfectly still as if to collect all his failing energies
for one mighty effort, partly raised himself and called
out something in a hoarse shriek, but with such vehemence
as to cause the first part to be quite unintelligible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of David’s voice brought Roy round on
his heel with a swing. His quick ear had caught the
word “gully.” The boy was lying on the table
breathing fast and hard, his keen black eyes watching
the trader with an eagerness that told that he was
anxiously waiting to be further questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gully! gully!” said Roy to himself; “What
does he mean?” Then, in a flash it came to him.
About a mile from the “little hill” was a gully,
Peter’s gully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he essayed an explanation from David.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was now a glad, happy look on the boy’s face
as if by some means he had discovered that Roy was
in possession of the name he had tried so very hard
to utter. Probably Roy’s look of relief, or, what is
more likely, the movement of his lips, as he repeated
the words to himself, had given the boy his cue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was scarcely put before it was answered
by those black eyes, which closed several times
in as many flashes. Then, as if the excited boy’s unnaturally
pent-up feelings had suddenly broken bonds
he gave a horrible, ghastly laugh that sent an unpleasant
thrill through all within hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie, who had remained perfectly impassive
while Roy was interrogating David, jumped excitedly
to his feet at the sound of this unnatural
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” he demanded, gazing around him
in a scared, bewildered fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy touched the old man’s arm softly. “Come,
Delgezie,” he said, cheerfully. “We will now go and
find Kasba; David thinks she might be sheltering
in Peter’s Gully. I think we can find that even in
this drift, eh, old man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Chipewyan started suddenly at hearing
his daughter’s name. He gazed at Roy for a moment
in doubt, then, perceiving a smile on his face,
he smiled pathetically in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” he replied, and at once started for
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! Catch hold of this,” cried Roy, pitching
one of the bundles to him, then slipping the other over
his own shoulder. “We must go equipped or we may
as well stay at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distracted father was now all impatience to
be off. But Roy paused to give Broom a few
instructions for the proper disposal of David. Then,
carrying a small compass in his hand, he walked outside,
closely followed by the old Indian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Closing the door, Roy paused to take his bearings
by the compass, then started after Delgezie, who was
already some yards in front. He did not seek to
overtake the old man, but followed close behind,
keeping him in sight except, occasionally, when a
snow-cloud enveloped him for a few moments. The
force of the wind was terrific. It swept over the
plain howling like a pack of wolves, and drove the
men before it at a great pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After scudding along at this unusual speed for
some time the air became literally filled with snow-flakes
and the darkness thickened. It was with
utmost difficulty that Roy was able to consult the
compass. But feeling assured that he was going in
the right direction he allowed the wind to blow him
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the darkness lifted and Roy gazed about
him in search of Delgezie, but nowhere could he be
seen. A ridge of rocks loomed out of the gloom and
caused Roy to consult the compass anew. “You’re
a bit of a liar, my friend,” he murmured, slipping
the offending instrument into his mitten in token
of his disgust, for he knew by the character of the
rocks that he had come directly south and not south-west
as he had intended—the compass had proved
incorrect, as compasses frequently do in the Far
North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” thought Roy, “I may as well have a look
now that I am here,” and with this determination he
steered his way to a small ravine which he knew ran
through the rocks before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there he lustily shouted the girl’s name, but
there was no response, and after a time he turned
and left the ravine in an attempt to reach Peter’s
Gully, his original destination. However, he had
not walked far into the open before he stumbled and
fell, and picking himself up he found that he had
tripped over a pair of snowshoes. These he eagerly
scrutinized. From their size he perceived that they
belonged to Kasba, and with a terrific yell that fairly
outrivalled the howling of the wind he recommenced
his search for their owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After searching for some time, Roy discovered an
object huddled in a hollow of the rocks and sprang
forward with a low cry of eagerness, but in his
impetuosity he tripped and fell heavily. The noise
and ejaculation occasioned by the fall apparently
awoke the object into life. For a little cloud of
snow arose as a covering was suddenly thrown back
and the girl’s face appeared. Roy struggled to his
feet with a laugh, but it was with a sobered air that
he approached Kasba.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you all right, Kasba?” he inquired, anxiously
peering down at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl nodded; she was too cold to articulate,
and unable to rise from the same cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving this, Roy caught her up in his arms
to transport her to another part of the ravine where,
as he knew, there was plenty of dry wood for a fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Kasba was brought into the closest possible
contact with the man she loved, and, despite her
resolution to think of him no more, she nestled in
Roy’s strong embrace with a little sigh of complete
contentment; she felt that the severe hardships she
had undergone in the blizzard were proving
blessings in disguise now that they had given her
these moments of rapturous happiness. Her little
brown hand stole to his shoulder caressingly and she
pressed closer to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could feel the beautiful form of the young
girl pressing against his breast. She was such a
child, and was so little and dainty, that the temptation
to respond to her caress was not to be withstood,
and lowering his head a little he kissed her on the
full lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instant he did it he felt a pang of conscience
for his act. It seemed like a sacrilege after just
receiving letters from Lena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had done it more thoughtlessly than otherwise,
besides he was overjoyed at finding the girl
safe and well. She had had a miraculous escape.
Still, he realized he had done wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba sighed rapturously. He could feel her
heart throbbing, and for a moment she clung to him
passionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this display of passion, he more than ever
doubted the wisdom of his act. He had not intended
playing the lover to this half-savage child. He felt
he had played the villain. He knew she had more
than ordinary intelligence and that if he went on in
that way he would break her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disengaged himself kindly and stood her upon
her feet, but she still clung to his arm, hugging it
to her bosom. Her face was flushed and joyous: he
had kissed her, and all eternity could not take from
her the memory of that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Roy, in my opinion, he was certainly skating
over very thin ice.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>ENTERTAINING THE “PACKET” MEN.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>During the next few days the sufferers from
exposure and travel quickly recuperated, and in a
week all were once again in their accustomed good
health. Kasba had luckily escaped Jack Frost’s
most tenacious embrace, and a few hours had been
sufficient to enable her to throw off the lethargy
occasioned by her perilous adventure. David, on
the other hand, had suffered painfully. The parts
of his body that had been frozen became swollen and
inflamed to an alarming degree, but as the blood
regained its accustomed circulation the swelling
slowly subsided. After two days of careful nursing
the boy had been removed to Delgezie’s hut, where
he had quickly recovered the use of his limbs and
elasticity of spirits, while any fatigue the little dog-driver
and his partner might have felt by their long
journey had been entirely shaken off after several
good nights’ rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy had traded with the few Eskimo encamped
at the Fort and sent them about their business. A
large seamless sack, whose sides bulged alarmingly,
standing behind the counter in the trading store, had
been the cynosure of their oblique eyes. This was
the damning evidence of Ocpic’s cupidity, the sack
he had filled with goods during the time he was in
possession of Roy’s store key, but had been prevented
from transporting from the premises for some unaccountable
reason—probably some sound had alarmed
him and caused him to leave the store post-haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo spoke among themselves respecting
the incident, and from the fragmentary conversation
Roy overheard whilst engaging in trading with them
he gathered that they felt more regret at Ocpic’s
failing to take the goods away than at his behavior.
And this was not to be wondered at, for they were
acquainted with Roy only as a man who gave “nothing
for nothing,” while Ocpic was of their own race,
and truly blood is thicker than water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trading-store was a small, unpretentious
building of undressed plank. It contained every
imaginable commodity likely to be required for the
Eskimo trade: cloth of red and blue, white capotes,
blankets, scalpy knives, dags (snow-knives), pocket-knives,
white seed beads, telescopes, tin and copper
kettles of various sizes and a large stock of firearms,
etc. First of all an Eskimo handed his bale of furs
over the counter to Roy, who counted and valued
them. Having done this, the trader handed the
native a number of pins (pieces of wood), which the
native with great deliberation arranged upon the
counter, first in tens, then into little piles according
to how much he wanted to buy of any one article.
Each of these pieces of wood represented a “skin,”
or, as it is sometimes called, a “made beaver,” the
standard valuation by which trade is carried on
between the Hudson’s Bay Company and the natives
in that northern country. Having selected an article
valued at, say, eight skins, the native handed over
eight of his pieces of wood in exchange, and continued
this method of doing business till all were gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As each native finished his bartering he fell out
of the gang which thronged before the counter, and
retired to the particular <span class='it'>iglo</span> he inhabited to gloat
over his purchases. After untying the bundle which
he had tied up in the store with such security as to
lead one to imagine that he never again intended to
unloose it, he took each purchase in hand separately,
felt the edges of the knives, admired their workmanship
and shape, closely scrutinized the large tin
kettles and went into raptures over their shining
brightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trading done and the Eskimo away from the
Fort, Roy gave his attention to the accounts and
letters he wished to send by the return “packet.”
The packet-train’s stay at Fort Future was limited
to one week by the hard-and-fast rules governing the
Company’s “packets,” and Roy’s search for Kasba
and his trading with the natives had occupied several
days of this time, but at an isolated post like Fort
Future the official correspondence was not heavy and
he was easily able to accomplish that part of his
duties in due season. The work of writing his private
letters, however, was more protracted. It was
only in the evenings, after the loquacious Broom had
retired, that Roy could apply himself to these. But
by continuing his labors into the small hours of the
morning he arose from the table on the last day of
the allotted time with his work completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the “packet” off his mind, Roy turned his
thoughts to giving Hopkins and his companion a
good send-off, and accordingly he arranged for a
dance to take place that evening. Sahanderry was
told to make a large supply of raisin cakes and to
coax his dilapidated fiddle into tune. And the
delighted Indian proceeded to carry out these orders
with much jubilation. Soon little squares of dough,
spotted with raisins, lay on top of the stove, and the
pleasant smell of newly-cooked cakes filled the house
all morning. During the afternoon the Indian
brought out his fiddle and started to tune it. At this
Broom uttered fearful imprecations and threatened
to throw various objects at the fiddler’s head, but
Roy, greatly amused, allowed Sahanderry to go on
with his tuning, and the Indian continued the nerve-racking
process with diabolical ingenuity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as supper was over, Sahanderry and Hopkins
prepared the kitchen for the coming ball, and
when everything was in readiness and the guests
assembled Roy was apprised of the fact. There was
a short delay occasioned by Broom, who at the last
moment decided to groom his hair and unkempt
whiskers, then the trader and his companion put in
an appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba’s face at once filled with delight. She had
not forgotten the caress she had received from
Bekothrie; her lips where his had pressed them
tingled still. And when he stood up for the first
dance with her, thereby elating her into a seventh
heaven of happiness, the crimson flew to her cheeks
and brow. She tossed her head and smiled very prettily,
her heart glowing in her eyes, and I must confess
she clung to his hand, as they went through the
figure dances, a good deal longer than was necessary;
also, I may as well tell you at once, she put up her
lips, when she bade him good-night, standing on tip-toe
that she might reach his face. He received her
salute with a little laugh of embarrassment, and in
truth was too much worried over what she had done
to allow of his sleeping after he turned in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba was the only woman present at this singular
entertainment, but the absence of lady partners
seemed in no wise to detract from the jollity of the
evening. Hopkins, Poo-koo and David faced Broom,
Delgezie and Minnihak, while Roy had Kasba for
partner, as we have just described, and jigs, country
dances, figures of eight, duck dances and rabbit
dances were one and all performed with commendable
spirit. There was a little confusion in the set
dances caused by an occasional mix-up of partners
or a dancer jigging alone down the perspective, but
these mistakes only added to the fun of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first solemnity and much perspiration marked
these performances, but as pint after pint of “sugar
beer” was swallowed by the thirsty dancers, their
solemnity wore away, a gayer humor prevailed and
some most intricate steps were ventured upon and
accomplished with more or less success by the juvenile
members of the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the evening progressed, Broom suddenly burst
into a song, much to Roy’s astonishment, for the
sailor had often declared himself incapable of singing
a note. The comic expression of Broom’s face created
much amusement, and when he ended his performance
by shuffling a few steps after the orthodox
manner of the music-hall artists the delight of his
audience knew no bounds, and the fun waxed fast
and furious till the clock pointed to the hour of midnight.
At the striking of the hour, Roy shook hands
with all present, and then, led by Broom, three
cheers were given for “the master,” and the party
quickly dissolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite their terpsichorean efforts of the previous
evening they were all up betimes next morning.
Even Broom arose much before his wonted hour to
see the packet men start on their return journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good luck, George!” cried Roy, grasping
the little dog-driver by the hand. “May you have
a good trip!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir,” returned the little man, who
hastily proceeded to shake hands with all within
sight, which act of courtesy was closely imitated
by Poo-koo. And while it was yet dark the packet-train
started on its hazardous journey south. The
dogs, greatly refreshed by their rest, bounded after
the rapidly disappearing Eskimo in front, who,
unlike most of his race, was a good and fast walker,
and the last link to the outside world was quickly
swallowed up in the gloom of the early morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an unconscious sigh of regret Roy turned to
go indoors. To be sure Churchill was as much out
of the world as Fort Future, but there were more
people—possibly a dozen—and four mails a year
there. Four mails a year looked good to Roy.
Truly all things are judged by comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy’s naturally buoyant spirits seemed to have
departed with the packet and he appeared dull and
listless, remaining preoccupied during the whole of
breakfast, and returning only monosyllabic answers
to Broom’s airy remarks. The interesting occupation
of letter-writing gone, there seemed nothing to
occupy his mind, and it was with something of an
effort that he forced himself to take up the old
monotonous life and to revive the interest he had
hitherto felt in his work. But these feelings, this
hankering after the unattainable, was soon dispersed
by his strong will, and he was again the zealous officer
the Company had ever found him. He was inwardly
longing for the time when the ice would be out of the
river, and Chief Factor McCall would arrive on his
trip of inspection, and the knowledge that Lena was
to accompany her father only made the enforced wait
the more exasperating. But Roy knew from bitter
experience that the only way to make time fly was to
be fully occupied, and he therefore decided to make
a trip to the camp of his Eskimo trader Acpa.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span><h1>CHAPTER X.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>A TRIP TO AN ESKIMO ENCAMPMENT.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Roy and Broom spent the evening following in
desultory conversation. The latter was feeling in
one of his best moods, but a strange presentiment of
coming evil beset the trader; that peculiar instinctive
feeling of some approaching calamity with which
we are all more or less acquainted; the shadowy,
indistinct sensation that some catastrophe is nigh
and about to overwhelm us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Roy’s naturally buoyant spirits were not prone
to fits of depression he felt irritated with himself and
attempted to throw it off, but the feeling was so persistent,
so singularly distinct, that it caused him to
hesitate about making the journey. It was only by a
supreme effort that he suppressed these premonitions
of evil and bent his mind on the business before
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had arranged for Minnihak to accompany him
as guide, and Delgezie to follow with a second train
of dogs. Consequently the charge of the Fort fell
to Sahanderry, who was summoned to the inner room
to receive his orders. Roy made a point of giving
these instructions in the presence of Broom, so that
he might perfectly understand his position and that
he remained at the Fort merely as a guest, and that
except for the preparing of his meals the Chipewyan
was in no wise under his direction or supervision.
After establishing this fact beyond any possibility
of doubt, Roy dismissed Sahanderry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now we’ll take a last horn together,” he
said, little thinking how prophetic his words would
prove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, old man,” returned the sailor. Then,
as if the thought had suddenly flashed upon him, he
added: “By the way, you might leave a drop with
me, old chap; the time will be deuced long while
you’re away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy shot him a quick glance and remained silent
for some moments as if debating within himself.
He turned and lingered over the spirit chest, and
then, alas, against his better judgment, he produced
two bottles of whiskey which he handed to the sailor.
There was nothing in these innocent black bottles
to warn him that they would be chiefly instrumental
in bringing about the catastrophe his gloomy forebodings
had foreshadowed—<span class='it'>the imp of evil was there</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be away only four days if the weather
holds good,” said Roy. Then looking the other
straight in the eyes he added a little more seriously,
but with a smile: “Of course I depend upon you
behaving yourself, Broom. You’ve given your word
that you will try no more foolishness with Kasba,
and I trust you. I have given you the liquor you
asked for, but I don’t expect you to make an ass of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom smiled broadly while engaged in stowing
the bottles under a pillow of his bunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me, what a doubting Thomas you are!” he
said. Then, with the theatrical manner he was so
fond of assuming, he added: “You may proceed on
your hazardous journey, my good Samaritan, with
the greatest confidence in your humble servant’s
future exemplary behavior. He will conduct himself
in the most approved manner during your
absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this virtuous assurance, Broom partly filled
an enamelled mug with whiskey from a bottle on the
table, and, raising it in the air, drank to “a successful
trip.” “May you return with your sleds loaded
down with furs,” he cried, in a more friendly spirit
than he had shown for some time past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thanking him for his wishes, Roy drank the liquor
he had mixed for himself, and prepared for bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must excuse me,” he said, “for I am making
an early start in the morning. But don’t let
my going to bed interfere with your enjoyment.
There is not much in the bottle, you might as well
finish it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom muttered something about the other’s generosity
and drew the bottle toward him, while Roy
made haste to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trading party left the Fort long before daylight
next morning and were many miles away when
the “day-sky” crept over the horizon, for the dogs
were going well. Neither of the <span class='it'>com-it-uks</span> was
loaded very heavily, although they appeared to be so
from their bulk, but this was caused by the amount
of bedding, changes of clothing, and other useful
gear that trippers in the Far North are compelled to
take with them when making a trip, it does not
matter how short, in winter; for a blizzard, like that
in which Kasba was lost, easily protracts a short trip
into one of several days’ duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed all too quickly for the little party,
who, keenly alive to the changeableness of the weather
at that time of the year, endeavored to push on with
the greatest speed possible. With this end in view,
only one short stop was made “to boil the kettle,” as
the phrase goes. Beyond this there was no stopping,
and each of the men was aware of sundry severe
promptings from an empty stomach long before the
approaching dusk compelled them to camp for the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a word from Roy the guide selected a suitable
spot, and the dogs were brought to a halt in a little
bluff of trees. The place chosen was not an ideal
one, for the brush was poor and dry wood scarce,
but, as the men well knew, there was no better for
some miles, and they lost no time in idle speculation
or useless regrets. Silently, and with the skilful
precision and dexterity of men well accustomed to
the work, they went about their several duties, each
to his own task, knowing what was expected of him.
To Delgezie fell the task of “making camp.” Having
picked a spot free from underwood and where
there were no holes, he slipped off his snowshoes
and using one as a spade proceeded to clear the
ground of snow, while Roy, acting as the old man’s
assistant, cut and brought suitable spruce trees which
Delgezie “branched” as soon as he had cleared a
space some ten feet square, strewing the small
branches thickly over the uncovered ground, and at
the same time making a three-sided barricade some
four feet high out of the robbed trunks. The back
of the camp was toward the wind, while the front,
or open side of the square, was reserved for the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The camp built, Roy stopped cutting “brush” and
joined Minnihak in procuring “dry wood,” which
Delgezie cut into lengths as soon as brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the trader and the Chipewyan turned their
attention to the dogs, which were unharnessed, tied
to adjacent trees and bedded down with brush. A
terrific clamoring ensued, for long experience told
the dogs that these acts betokened the feeding hour.
Four pounds of venison were now thrown to each of
them, as a reward for the faithful efforts of the day,
and on a tree near by a bag containing a night’s feed
for men and dogs was cached for the return journey.
Thus the <span class='it'>com-it-uks</span> were lightened by many pounds’
weight the first day out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Minnihak had a fire blazing fiercely
and throwing its glare all about them, making the
camp appear a comfortable haven indeed, as compared
to the cold, bleak surroundings, and Roy and
Delgezie stepped into its warm radius and knocked
the snow from their moccasins and trousers with
their thick deerskin mittens, smiling the pleased
smile of weary men satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duties of cook fell upon the guide, Minnihak,
according to the rules of tripping. But although
the Eskimo had acquired the elements of civilization
he was sadly remiss in the nicer details of cleanliness,
which made his services in that capacity quite
undesirable. Therefore Delgezie cooked the food,
while Minnihak carried out the more menial labors
of cook’s mate, in pursuance of which he had already
gone to a near-by river and brought back several
large blocks of ice for the kettle, and these lay ready
to the cook’s hand, glistening in the firelight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supper over, the men gave themselves up to a few
minutes’ smoke and reverie—the most delightful
time of the tripper’s day—and their thoughts naturally
turned to sleep. Delgezie, who always held
prayer before retiring, began a hymn, which he sang
alone, for Roy was unable to follow the old man’s
peculiar intonation, and Minnihak was ignorant of
both language and tune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a reverie Roy’s gaze wandered from the bright
glow of the fire, through the few <a id='sparse'></a>sparse spruce trees
and out to the cold, desolate region beyond. The
moon was shining brightly, illuminating the surrounding
solitude which stretched into the far distance
on either side like a terrestrial eternity, having
no visible beginning or end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a shudder of awe at the weird grandeur,
profound silence, and magnitude of the scene, Roy
realized himself an insignificant atom in God’s great
plan of creation, and his eyes, following the bent of
his thoughts, instinctively sought the heavens, where
they discovered a magnificent lunar halo, a white
corona with a pale-hued edge completely encircling
the moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Withdrawing his gaze from this beautiful phenomenon
as Delgezie fell on his knees to pray, Roy
whipped off his cap and stood with head reverently
bowed while the old man stumbled through the General
Confession. At the words “<span class='it'>Nota Yaka Thenda
Nese</span>” (Our Father, etc.), Roy repeated the prayer
with such fervor as to cause the Eskimo to look up
in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None but those who have witnessed it can understand
the singularly striking effect of such a scene—the
small, rudely constructed camp with the fire
throwing its glare afar; the profound silence; the
vast surrounding solitudes and the little group
of devotees, apparently alone in an immense wilderness,
their faces lit by the lurid glow of the fire; the
gentle soughing of the wind; the celestial canopy
bright with myriads of twinkling stars—all this appeals
to the imagination and, despite an inclination
to ridicule, a distinctly religious feeling prevails,
while thoughts prone to wander on excursions of
levity are brought sharply to order and turned
inward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie was the last to retire. Before lying
down the old Indian made all secure from fire
by pushing the burning embers out in the snow.
Then, after making certain that the trader was well
covered, he raised himself to take a last look about
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light wind from the west seemed somewhat
capricious and threatened to change to another point
of the compass. This caused Delgezie some uneasiness;
he feared it might change during the night,
which meant a change of camp. And changing
camp in the dark, on a bitter-cold night, is a most
disagreeable experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left to his own devices, Broom sat at his lonely
breakfast on the morning of Roy’s departure, racking
his brains for a means of diverting himself. The
big loneliness of the place had been penetrating his
soul for some time, and now that he was deprived
of Roy’s society there was nothing to relieve the
death-like monotony of the life. To find something
sufficiently interesting to make the time pass quickly
seemed to him a necessity, for the man’s mentality
was as weak in this respect as that of a boy or a
frisky animal. But a new divertisement was difficult
to devise. Sleep? He was tired of sleeping.
It seemed to him that he did nothing else. Books?
He was satiated with reading. The gun? He was
no shot, and the weather was intensely cold. Conversation?
Nothing would delight him more, but
there was no one but Sahanderry and Kasba to speak
to. Sahanderry was unfriendly, and Kasba—the
forbidden fruit. The whiskey? Ha! This indeed
offered great possibilities, it tempted him almost
beyond his powers of resistance, but his promise to
Roy, though given in a facetious manner, was as
binding to him as anything could well be, and drink,
as an entertainment, was excluded thereby. Traps?
Should he attend his traps? It was a clear morning,
with no wind; cold? yes, but he could guard against
that. Yes, he would visit his traps. It would please
Roy, he knew, therefore he would go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with feelings of righteous self-abnegation—an
odd sensation and entirely new to this hardened
sinner—that he proceeded to his traps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his magnanimity he went so far as to invite
Sahanderry to take a drink with him before starting,
but the Indian, hugging his animosity closely,
refused. Broom’s unprecedented cordiality, however,
was not entirely wasted. It had a mollifying
effect upon the Indian, for he fixed the netting of
the sailor’s snowshoes with greater care than he would
otherwise have done, and even departed from his
customary morose manner toward him to wish him
“good luck” when he started on his quest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom went on his way strangely thoughtful.
There was a new-found joy in the thought that he
had denied himself the drink. He was even conscious
of feeling virtuous—a sensation quite foreign
to him of late—and under the influence of this new
experience life seemed to take on a new aspect. He
was not given to conscientious scruples, and the sensation
was not altogether pleasant, for, stripped of
his habitual indifference, he stood revealed in a new
guise, and found the picture not good to look upon.
Everything around him was of unsullied whiteness;
the very stillness and profound solitude cried loudly
to him of the Creator. He felt out of harmony with
his surroundings, knew that he was the one black
spot in a region clothed with a mantle of purity, and,
like the progenitor of the human race, he was
ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rime fell lightly in prismatic crystals, scintillating
and glistening in the bright sunshine all about
him, and in the heavens there was a magnificent
spectacle, a beautiful celestial phenomenon: the sun
shining through the falling rime took the shape of
a fiery cross, and on each side of this sublime luminary,
at some little distance, shone a luminous ball,
and, attached to each of these, on the side farthest
from the sun, and rising perpendicularly, was a little
rainbow which extended in glowing bands of deep
red, orange, and light blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stretching out from these were bars of silver reaching
across the heavens on each side like gigantic
arms and ending in indistinct vaporous clouds like
huge hands which appeared about to clutch the earth
in their embrace. Higher in the heavens, and
exactly above the sun, a crescent, its colors corresponding
with the beautiful sections of the rainbow,
shone out brightly, and at different points around
the horizon indistinct rainbow hues were visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom was by now well accustomed to the many
splendid phenomena of the Far North, but the present
magnificent spectacle—catching him at a time
when he stood disarmed, when for the moment his
mantle of indifference and cynicism had fallen from
him—influenced him strangely. However, a mind
perturbed with religious feelings was unusual to
Broom, and like the now fast-disappearing phenomenon,
this unusual experience was soon gone. With
the arrogance natural to mankind he stifled this
slight inclination, this prompting toward reform, and
lapsed into the hardened, cynical reprobate he naturally
was, at least to outward seeming. Alas! what a
number of Mr. Brooms there are in the world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fate, luck, or Providence, call it which you will,
reciprocated Broom’s magnanimous feelings by smiling
on him. His hunting-bag by the time he had
visited all his traps was swollen to undue proportions
and bore significant signs of <a id='good'></a>good luck. He was
greatly elated at this success. Scorning his customary
long, slouching stride as a mode of locomotion
too slow to keep pace with his excited feelings, he
covered the ground at a quick trot and arrived at the
Fort in a thoroughly exhausted condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phew! That’s warm work,” he cried as he
entered the door and found Sahanderry standing
before him with the vestige of a smile on his dark
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many?” inquired Sahanderry shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five, my boy!” Broom dropped the bag of
foxes to the floor with a long sigh of relief. His
face was scarlet. He was “blowing like a grampus,”
and now that he was in the house he perspired freely.
“Guess I’ve earned a drink,” he said, and passing
into the inner room, quickly produced the bottle and
mug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After taking a goodly modicum of whiskey he
eyed the bottle dubiously. The liquor had shrunk
in an incredible manner: a few more such potations
and he would arrive at the bottom of the bottle. To
guard against the calamity of running out of liquor
altogether the tippler made a mental reservation to
drink only one-third of his stock of whiskey on each
of the following days, thereby securing an allowance
for each day of Roy’s absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In theory the scheme was undoubtedly good, and
well worthy of the versatile sailor, but in practice it
did not turn out as well as he expected. For when
he tumbled out of bed on the third morning, with an
exceedingly hazy idea of how he ever got into it, he
discovered to his chagrin that the whiskey was almost
all gone. Evidently nothing but an overpowering
fit of slumber had prevented him from drinking the
whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting on the edge of the bunk, feeling dull and
miserable, he was conscious of a raging, overpowering
thirst, and it was with the greatest difficulty that
he laid restraining hands on himself and drank only
enough of the already greatly depleted liquor to discover,
as he told himself, if what remained was the
real stuff. But this potation not only proved its
genuineness, but also greatly revived him, or, in his
own expressive language, “it made him feel a bit
more perky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After putting the bottle aside with the scrupulous
carefulness of a miser secreting gold, he sank into a
chair and sat in drowsy contemplation for a few
minutes. Then, casting a disconsolate eye around
him, his gaze encountered Roy’s liquor chest with its
neat fastenings and lock. Immediately a fancied
procession of the black bottles danced before his
burning eyes. The thought that most likely a considerable
quantity of whiskey lay in the snug-looking
box and within easy reach brought him upright in
his chair with a jerk and he sat gazing at it as if
fascinated. Then, withdrawing his eyes with an
effort, he sprang suddenly to his feet and, catching
up his coat and hat, rushed from the room, clutching
his snowshoes as he ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once outside and away from the dangerous fascinations
of the locked chest Broom paused and wiped
the perspiration from his brow. He stood irresolute
for a moment, then, with an air of grim determination,
turned in the direction of his traps, plodding
onwards with leaden footsteps, weary and breakfastless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like one in a dream he stumbled on his way. A
burning fire seemed to be consuming his vitals; flashes
of heat and cold passed over him; his hands became
moist, and he felt utterly fatigued. He was walking
mechanically now and his nether limbs seemed to
move like pendulums, forcing him to continue the
function of walking, to drag his weary body along
without any effort of will or possibility of staying
their movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return he could discover no sign of Sahanderry’s
presence and for this he was devoutly thankful;
for he felt too jaded, too dejected, to encounter
the gaze of his watchful enemy. On nearing the
Fort, he had endeavored to recover his old careless
“bon-aire” expression, but he was conscious that the
effort had been a miserable failure, and, therefore,
the Indian’s absence proved both a relief and a boon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing aside his outdoor apparel he sank into
a chair where he sat profusely perspiring like a man
prostrated by weakness. He braced himself in his
seat to resist the temptation that he knew would
come. Sinking back, he gripped the sides of his
chair with the tenacity of one in a delirium and
forced his gaze into a far corner of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding it impossible to keep his eyes fixed on
any one spot, he cast about him for something to
occupy his mind. He could not go outside, for the
weather was too intensely cold to allow anyone to
sit down, and he felt too ill and weary to walk about
any more. His breakfast stood upon the table, where
it had been placed by Sahanderry many hours before,
but it remained untasted, for he could not eat. He
had no desire for food, but the appetite for strong
liquor was almost mastering him. He knew the
feeling and dreaded it. In his desperation he
reached for a book that protruded from under the
pillow in his bunk, then again sinking back in his
chair, he endeavored to read. But the print danced
before his eyes, the large capital letters grouped
themselves together and stood leering at him. Suddenly
in place of the dancing printed type he saw
a smooth wooden box, the lid fastened with a strong
lock; for unconsciously the book had dropped from
his hands and he was again staring at Roy’s spirit
chest. After this he seemed to lose all consciousness
of things around him, his whole attention was
riveted on the object of his gaze. Presently he stiffened
himself as to resist some powerful shock; probably
the last spark of manhood was making vigorous
struggles to extricate him from so pitiful a position.
Beads of perspiration stood on his brow, and he fell
to trembling like a man with the palsy. To his
heated imagination the lid of the box slid slightly
back and a long thin hand protruded itself and was
beckoning him on. Then, as the hand still beckoned,
several black bottles slipped out also and began a
grotesque dance upon the lid, while others thrust
forth their heads to laugh, grimly, and make horrible
grimaces at him. Suddenly Broom started to
his feet. He passed a trembling hand across his eyes
and then, with a sigh of abject helplessness, staggered
forward to fall on his knees before the fascinating
chest which he now eagerly scanned. With a cry
more animal than human, he began to take off its
hinges with his pocket knife, for apart from the
strong lock, Roy had attempted no precautions to
make the box secure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight snapping of the fire caused Broom to
stop in his frenzied labors and to glare around the
room like a hunted animal. But, apparently satisfied
that no one was there, he returned to his task, working
at the hinges with the cunning of a man bordering
on delirium tremens. In a few moments the screws
were out and the lid thrown back from the rear, the
hasp and staple acting as a hinge. Then with a
snarl of disappointment the wretched man sprang
to his feet, for with the exception of one bottle the
box was empty. In his heated imagination he had
pictured it filled to the top with rows of shining
bottles and now he stood for a moment glaring around
him like a wild beast defrauded of its prey, and well
was it for Sahanderry that he did not appear upon
the scene at that moment. Then uttering a little
chuckle Broom dropped on his knees and clutched
ravenously at the one bottle, which he fondled and
caressed with a foolish cooing noise horrible to hear;
while the hands of the bewildered wretch were now
shaking so as to threaten destruction to the bottle’s
contents. With the cunning of a madman Broom
perceived this, and rising to his feet, and mastering
his agitation with a strong effort, he began to draw
the cork with the aid of two pocket-knives. “Experience
makes perfect,” and Broom had become
dexterous in the art of cork drawing. So this cork
was soon extracted and the neck of the bottle hastily
glued to his trembling lips. He took several long
pulls before placing it upon the table, then, in a dazed
and mechanical way, he replaced the hinges upon
the box by returning the screws to their places. He
now stood slowly swaying from side to side, his face
wearing a curious expression like one slowly returning
to consciousness. Grasping the bottle with both
hands, he took another deep draught, then fell upon
his bed panting and exhausted, as if from some supreme
exertion. After a few minutes of restlessness
he fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Sahanderry peeped into the room a little
later, he found Broom sleeping tranquilly. The Indian
glanced from the sailor to the bottle on the table,
and believing it to be one of those given him by Roy,
smiled contemptuously, while his idea of the sailor’s
drinking capabilities underwent a quick change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning Sahanderry was vastly surprised to
find the sailor in the same position. He was sleeping
heavily, as his deep breathing and nasal accompaniment
testified, and his prolonged slumber aroused
the Indian’s suspicion. Stepping lightly across to
the chest he carefully scrutinized the lock, but found
no evidence of its having been tampered with. What
then had produced Broom’s long sleep? Sahanderry
lifted the bottle from the table and held it up to the
light. It was still a quarter full. This was astounding.
Despite the Indian’s obtuseness he was sharp
enough to perceive that Broom must have procured
other liquor. But from where? And how? Sahanderry
shrugged his shoulders, and spreading out his
hands in a deprecating gesture he washed them of the
whole business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the day when Broom awoke from his
long season of unconsciousness, for slumber it could
hardly be called. Rising from his elbow, he gazed
about him. His head ached excruciatingly. His
brain seemed on fire. His tongue felt tough and dry
so that he found it hard to articulate. With a moan
he fell back upon the pillow to collect his scattered
senses and as he slowly awoke to the full consciousness
of what he had done, a sentiment of bitterness
rose in his mind against himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he dropped over the side of the bunk and
reached for the bottle with an unsteady hand. As
he put it to his trembling lips a little of the liquor
trickled down his chin, and a sudden revulsion of
feeling came over him. Pushing the bottle away
with a look of malignant hate he paced the floor with
short unsteady steps, and with his long hair and
whiskers matted and disheveled, his face swollen and
flushed, his eyes intensely blood-shot and whole frame
trembling violently, he was indeed a pitiable sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the distracted man took his resolution.
He caught up his coat and struggled into it, but
when it came to securing the buttons his unsteady
hands fumbled and refused their office. With an exclamation
of impatience he again reached for the
bottle, and this time he drained it to the dregs. Then,
pulling on his cap savagely, he rushed from the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his perambulations were soon cut short and
he discovered himself stuck in the deep snow, for he
had left his snow-shoes behind. However, he did
not return for them; instead he took a circuitous
path made hard by constant usage and leading toward
the open, quite unaware that Kasba, ardently persuaded
by David, who wished to shoot some birds,
had also taken this easy route and was coming towards
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy and girl had gone but a short distance
when a flock of partridges rose with a whir-r-r and
flew to the rocks above them, and David with boyish
enthusiasm scrambled up the heights after the birds,
saying he would rejoin the girl farther down the
track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walking slowly with drooping head, Kasba went
<a id='thou'></a>thoughtfully along the path before her. She knew
every foot of the ground over which she went. Suddenly
she became aware of the close presence of another,
and starting she raised her frightened eyes.
Before her, leaning against a boulder, was Broom.
He stood with his back toward her, and his face
buried in his hands. He was apparently feeling ill
and dazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl shrank back as if she had been struck,
then for some moments she stood immovable, her
startled gaze fixed upon the bowed figure. Instinctively
she felt her danger. A stifled gasp escaped
her and tremors shook her frame from head to foot.
Yet she dare not turn back, for David would be waiting.
She must go on, or he would come to look for
her and discover Broom. She shuddered to think
what might happen then, for the impetuous boy
violently disliked the fellow and would not miss an
opportunity of annoying him. Besides Broom had
been drinking heavily. Sahanderry had communicated
his suspicions to her and from what she could
make out there seemed to be a great degree of truth
in them. Therefore she must not leave David.
Broom would be in a black humor after his drinking
bout. She shuddered again. But this was no time
for weakness. She would go on, she <span class='it'>must</span>. Firmly
bracing her nerves, Kasba stepped lightly forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With bated breath she moved, step by step, toward
the silent figure. Very slowly and stealthily she
approached him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man continued to stand perfectly still, but as
she drew nearer his motionless figure, she could
scarcely restrain herself from crying aloud, so acute
was her terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a last effort, a strong, determined effort, she
was beside him. The snow under her feet crunched
to her imagination like the report of a gun. Her
heart stood still, she felt discovery inevitable. With
a mighty effort she strangled the cry in her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boulder against which Broom leaned was close
beside the track, and the attitude he had assumed
caused him to occupy most of it. To pass him so
closely was to court certain discovery. Kasba resolved
to make a slight detour, but she had not
brought her snowshoes. She had left the house with
the intention of taking only a short walk along the
beaten track and had thought them unnecessary. Off
the track the snow was deep and soft. What should
she do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>On her left was a ridge of rocks presenting acclivities
of every degree; on her right was a strip of scrub
almost covered by loose snow. The track, beaten
hard by Sahanderry on constant journeyings to his
traps, led straight before her, and, blocking this
narrow path was the inert figure of Broom. But
between the track and the rocks was a narrow strip
that to all seeming was perfectly hard. This she
carefully tried with one foot. It bore her weight and
with steady, cautious steps she passed on for a short
time in safety. Then, with a peculiar, dull report,
the crust gave way and the girl sank to her knees in
soft snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom started nervously. Raising his head apprehensively
he at once discovered Kasba and her unfortunate
position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Broom’s eye upon her the distracted girl
ceased her ineffectual struggles and stood staring at
him wildly like one fascinated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he believed her to be one of the multitudinous
delusions of a deranged mind. But presently
he was convinced that it was no delirious fantasy,
but really Kasba’s self who was there, alone and in
his power, and he laughed the loud mirthless laugh
of one gone mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl quailed before his gaze of malicious
triumph, then turned and made frantic efforts to
release herself from the clogging snow and to regain
the hard track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast,” cried Broom, rushing in and grasping
her by the waist. “Not so fast, my little white
partridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In vain Kasba struggled while Broom rained hot
kisses on her mouth. She could not prevent him.
She was in his power indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just when she had given up in despair Broom
suddenly uttered a terrific yell and loosened his grip.
The girl stood bewildered. She was dimly conscious
that her captor had released her and was now scuffling
with something small and dark, and mechanically she
drew herself out of his reach. Then, floundering
desperately out of the soft snow to the beaten track,
she fled along with a speed born of panic-stricken
horror; never pausing, never looking back, but rushing
straight on and on—to her father’s hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom, swearing like a madman, looked about him.
A dark form had dropped seemingly from the sky,
to spring forward upon his right arm, where it clung
with the tenacious grip of a bulldog. He was taken
completely by surprise. In his nervously-excited condition
the suddenness of the attack had startled him.
He imagined himself assailed by some uncanny foe
or some fierce wolf, and he had released the girl the
better to defend himself, and Kasba was beyond all
possibility of recapture before he discovered, to his
chagrin, that his adversary was no ferocious animal,
but the boy David, who had discovered Kasba’s precarious
position and slid down the face of the almost
perpendicular rocks to launch himself upon her
assailant. In an ungovernable paroxysm of baffled
fury he now rained blows upon the boy’s unprotected
face. David clung to his wrists for some moments
longer, then sank on the snow with a moan of pain,
and lay there limp and lifeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom gazed stupidly at the still form for a moment,
then with a cry like that of a hunted animal
he rushed from the scene.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>AN ESKIMO ENCAMPMENT.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Contrast to Delgezie’s fears the wind played no
pranks with them that night, but after coquetting
around all points of the compass, suddenly died out
altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still it was with a grunt of disgust that he threw
back his blankets next morning, for a heavy rime was
falling and everything appeared white and cold to his
gaze. Glancing up at that celestial clock—the North
Guards—and finding its tail pointing well toward
the south, he arose and set about building a fire. But
the kindlings were coated with rime and he experienced
much difficulty in persuading them to ignite.
However after much patient coaxing the mass was at
last got into a blaze, and, unceremoniously awakening
his assistant with a dexterous kick, he proceeded to
prepare breakfast. Thus rudely awakened Minnihak
reluctantly drew himself from his warm robes—he
had no objection to the intense cold, but a decided
antipathy to early rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing the men astir, Roy arose also and shook
his bedding clear of the cloying rime before packing
it away in his bag. To take a hasty breakfast, “ice”
the <span class='it'>com-it-uks</span>, lash the loads, and harness the dogs
was the work of fully an hour, for the morning was
intensely cold, and everything unpleasantly chilly
and icy to the touch; falling on exposed parts of the
warm person, the rime at once became damp, then
froze, clogging the eyebrows and eyelashes, and any
hair on the face, with icy particles. It was one of the
coldest mornings of that winter, and the tenacious
clinging of the rime accentuated its chill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy and Delgezie completed their disagreeable task
of harnessing the dogs as quickly as possible, then
jumped into camp to warm their benumbed fingers,
while Minnihak followed more leisurely, smiling and
unperturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ik-ki-mai</span>” (It is very cold), he said laconically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy in his haste to lash the sled had inadvertently
touched the head of an axe with his naked hand,
thereby “burning” his fingers, and he now stood
nursing them with a rueful countenance, making,
because of this, a brief pause at the fire. But soon a
start was made, and by the time the sun had thrown
its cheering rays over the desolate wilderness, the
trippers were well on their journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their course for some distance followed the river,
then branched off sharply and ran along a little creek,
at the mouth of which Minnihak was seen to stop,
turn aside, and walk across to a partly built <span class='it'>iglo</span>,
which, from its appearance, Roy judged to be the
one in which Oulybuck had hanged his father and
brother, and when his dogs got abreast of it, he
stopped them and walked across to view this primitive
gallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The walls of this <span class='it'>iglo</span> apparently remained as they
had been first built, but the gruesome paraphernalia
was missing, the crossbar and line being probably
buried with the defunct Eskimos, and the block of
snow from whence they had launched themselves into
eternity thrown aside and drifted over. Deep imprints
on the snow walls told that death had come
only to the suicides after desperate struggles, and
two distinct mounds of snow a little to one side and
close together clearly marked the suicides’ graves.
A fox had been digging at one of them, and the excavations
had left the handle of a saw exposed to
view; for the belongings of the deceased Eskimos had
been buried with their bodies, after the custom of
their race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after leaving the ill-omened spot the travellers
came in sight of Acpa’s encampment. This
consisted of several <span class='it'>iglos</span> grouped together with an
unusually large one in the centre. The smaller <span class='it'>iglos</span>
were of the ordinary kind, but the big one bore unmistakable
signs of its owner’s quality and importance.
Not only was it larger than the others, but it
had two protuberances instead of one: the one, as in
the usual case, being the kitchen, as a wreath of blue
smoke ascending from it testified; and as Acpa held
the proud position of a trusted trader, the other without
doubt was used by him as a storehouse, a room
where the trader bartered with his brother Eskimos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of dogs were running in and out of the
<span class='it'>iglos</span>, and these at once gave the alarm; promptly
several rough, shaggy figures dragged themselves
through the tunnels leading to their various abodes
and stood watching the approaching dog trains. The
moment the <span class='it'>com-it-uks</span> arrived at the encampment
busy hands, with the characteristic readiness of the
Eskimo to assist, caught at the dogs while others
carried the bundles of merchandise away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the unharnessing and unloading were taking
place still other Eskimos were engaged erecting a
snow-house for Roy and the old Chipewyan, for the
trader invariably despatched his Eskimo guide to
sleep with a friend on these occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eskimo etiquette compelled the guest of honor to
wait in Acpa’s abode till his own was pronounced
ready for occupation, and in compliance with this
rule Roy dragged himself through the low entrance,
followed by a number of old men, women and
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got to his feet in the kitchen and went forward,
picking his way among the skulking dogs, which, like
the Irishman’s pig, were on terms of equality with
their master, to the large room in the centre, and once
there he gave a sigh of relief, for the air was less
stifling, albeit the ventilation still left much to be
desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Kaip-puks</span> were brought by members of the family
and spread on one of the elevated platforms or bed-steads
for Roy to sit upon, and he seated himself with
an inward hope that his claim on their hospitality
might be of the shortest duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bundles of merchandise he had brought for
Acpa were now lying in the small room adjoining,
which, as he conjectured, was used specially for such
purposes. The one in which he sat was large and
dome-shaped, while several pieces of comparatively
transparent ice had been let into the walls to afford
the necessary light. The storehouse and kitchen were
lit in like manner, but in the latter a few sticks of
driftwood were smouldering on some flat stones, the
smoke from these travelling to the roof in the most
erratic manner, occasionally darkening the larger
room in its wanderings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of men and women soon sauntered in,
and, squatting down at a little distance from Roy,
sat silently watching him, while friendly smiles
suffused their greasy faces; infants clothed only in a
hood, or perchance a tobacco pipe, were produced
with startling suddenness from the capacious hoods
of the women’s coats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grouped among the throng were old and feeble
Eskimos with the wrinkled faces, projecting cheekbones
and lantern jaws peculiar to the very aged, and
young wives with yellow complexions and bright, intelligent
faces, their hair ornamented in a fashion
peculiar to themselves, with a kind of pigtail formed
from the hair over each ear neatly braided, the ends
decorated with beads and deer-teeth, and bands of
brass worn across the forehead. Sprinkled among
the group were children of various ages, and probably
of both sexes, though their costumes were so exactly
alike that it was impossible to distinguish to which
sex each belonged. Altogether this close scrutiny was
oppressive, and when Acpa appeared some minutes
later, Roy’s face brightened perceptibly. “<span class='it'>Ay-hoo</span>-<span class='it'>ee-la?</span>”
(Finished?) he asked with the best attempt at
indifference he could muster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ay-hoo</span>” (short for It is finished), replied the
old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy slowly arose, intending to make a dignified
exit, but even a fur-trader’s powers of endurance have
their limits, and he stumbled quickly across the
kitchen and precipitated himself through the low exit
into the fresh air, and, with feelings of grateful relief,
filled his lungs with the crisp oxygen. His confinement
in the smoky <span class='it'>iglo</span> had made him quite ill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering the one erected for him by the hospitable
Eskimos, Roy found Delgezie awaiting his return and
supper prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Indian was smiling. “They’re giving a
dance,” he observed, glancing at the trader with eyes
that twinkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The deuce they are; and they’ll expect me to
attend, I suppose,” grumbled Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expect so,” said Delgezie drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further comment was stopped by the appearance
of Acpa, who approached with a face which radiated
cheerfulness and goodwill. He squatted down and
partook of the food handed to him with apparent
relish, for intercourse with the white man had given
him a taste for bread, tea and sugar, and even coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After finishing the meal he proffered his unwelcome
invitation in this wise: “The Innuit are
happy,” pause. “They are glad to see you,” pause
and a smile. “Innuit will dance,” another pause and
smile, then ingratiatingly, “The ‘master’ will come?”
Here an expansive smile spread over his heavy features
and broadened into a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy received the invitation with an assenting nod,
and forced a smile to his lips. He inwardly shrank
at the thought of having again to enter Acpa’s odorous
and smoky abode, yet he dissembled, for he knew
that his presence at the dance was a thing of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the soft tap-tap of a drum was heard,
and Acpa got slowly to his feet, while Roy arose
with assumed alacrity and followed his host to the
scene of revelry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the trader’s last visit a number of young
men had returned from the hunt, and these were now
seated in a circle eating ravenously of frozen meat,
raw and unsightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this occasion the <span class='it'>iglo</span> was lit by candles of
home manufacture, these being tapering pieces of
dry moss and balls of grease. The bands of brass
across the foreheads of the women shining brightly
in the subdued light; the circle of hungry Eskimos
devouring their food like as many ravenous animals;
the shadowy, indistinct figures of the old folk seated
on the outskirts of the throng, and the bright faces
of the children watching the assembly with keen and
earnest eyes, all combined to make the scene grotesquely
weird. And the tap-tapping of the drum
went steadily on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the circle of hunters had satisfied their
rapacious appetites, it slowly dissolved. Then,
snickering and joking, the women formed themselves
into a circle and the ball was opened by Acpa, who
stepped into the centre of the ring, carrying a drum
in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This peculiar instrument consisted of a piece of
parchment stretched tightly across a wooden hoop
with a straight handle attached. The parchment was
dampened before each performance, a tuning process
as novel as simple. Acpa struck the rim of the drum,
the top and bottom alternately, against a stick, held
in the left hand, while shuffling his feet in a semblance
of step dancing, then striking the drum in the
centre a few times, he threw back his grand old head
and gazed up at the top of the <span class='it'>iglo</span>—seemingly for
inspiration—then fell to shouting, the shouts diminishing
in volume as they increased in rapidity.
“<span class='it'>Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh-ee, oh-ee-ee, oh-ee-ee, oh-ee-ee!</span>”
This was the cue for the women’s chorus, and they now
rocked themselves backwards and forwards, repeating
in high-pitched voices: “<span class='it'>Ya-ya, ya-a-ya, ya-ya</span>,” while
the old man composed his song as he went along. The
sentiments were at times poetic. He first thanked
the “master” for coming to see him and expressed
a wish that he would be satisfied with his trip. Then
he spoke of his work and the work of the other Eskimos
of the encampment and many other things in
the daily lives of himself and companions. Occasionally
he lapsed into the monotonous <span class='it'>Ya-ya</span> of the
chorus, or fell to shouting <span class='it'>Oh-ee, oh-ee</span>, but the drum
beating was continuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards several other men followed in this
unique individual dance and then came the turn of
the perspiring chorus to disport themselves. But the
women’s <span class='it'>rôle</span> was the exact opposite of that of the
men, for they danced two at a time and at first were
as silent as nuns, and they used no drum. Staring
each other straight in the eyes they shuffled their feet,
repeating queer words wheezily at the back of their
throats, all accompanied by a peculiar indrawing of
the breath. Many gestures accompanied this uncanny
performance, such as pointing derisive fingers
at each other, this meaning “I think very little of
you,” pointing upwards and downwards (the significance
of which seemed in doubt) and lustily slapping
their cheeks and patting their breasts. Evidently
this was a dance of endurance, but at last the final
pair fell panting and exhausted, and, taking advantage
of this respite, Roy hastened to shake hands with
all present and to leave the <span class='it'>iglo</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gleam of dawn spread in one golden glow of
morning, and the day rose radiant over the world.
The <span class='it'>com-it-uks</span> were “light” and the dogs travelled
quickly, and the sun was still high when our little
party got back to the camp they had made on the
previous day, and, the wind being in the same direction
as when the camp was constructed, it was ready
for their use and their labors were thus lightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supper over, Minnihak went to inspect a trap he
had set when they were there before. Roy stretched
himself on the outside of his bedding and lay dozing,
while Delgezie occupied himself making “cakes” for
the morrow. He had been employed in this manner
for some time when he heard a slight crunching sound
as of something moving over the snow. He thought
it was the Eskimo returning from his quest and did
not lift his eyes. But as the moments went by and
no Eskimo appeared, he raised himself slowly and
looked around. A large wolf stood before him on the
very edge of the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was watching Delgezie with a wicked snarl that
left bare its ugly fangs. The hair along its backbone
stood up stiffly and its eyes gleamed threateningly.
It looked fiercely hungry and Delgezie expected it
to spring at him, but it stood motionless and the old
man’s eyes searched the camp for a gun, but he could
see no weapon, and then he remembered that the guns
had been left outside. He uttered a grunt of indignation—that
a lone wolf should invade his camp, seemingly
as the aggressor, was, for the old Indian, a new
experience. Keeping his eyes fixed on the wolf, Delgezie
stealthily reached for a billet of wood. The
animal watched him furtively; its long white fangs
snapped and it crouched as if about to spring, but
something in the old man’s unperturbed pose and
steady eye seemed to awe the beast and hold it aloof.
Delgezie felt cautiously for the billet, a particular
piece of green wood which as he knew lay beside the
fire. He dared not withdraw his gaze, and could only
grope blindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he uttered a terrific yell and came upright
with a bound. Feeling for the billet, he had
missed that which he sought and grasped one that was
burning. At the sudden and unexpected loud noise
the wolf wheeled quickly and fled away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie’s yell brought Roy sharply to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the world’s the matter, man?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wolf in camp,” replied Delgezie, nursing his
injured fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you waken me? I could have shot
it,” demanded Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guns outside,” said the old man drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whipping a revolver from his hip-pocket, Roy
said: “I keep this little thing for occasions like that.”
Then observing that Delgezie was in pain, he added,
“But what have you done to your fingers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delgezie explained, and his adventure caused much
amusement during the rest of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning, Delgezie, with Minnihak
as guide, left the track in order to get a load of
meat from a cache some distance from the camp and
off the direct route to the Fort, and sitting on the sled
smoking idly while the dogs ran briskly to the sound
of jingling bells, Roy returned to the Fort alone.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>A DASTARDLY DEED.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When Broom came to himself after rushing from
the scene of his violence he discovered that he had
returned instinctively to the Fort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding the house in darkness he groped his way
across the kitchen to the inner room, where, after a
little, he succeeded in finding and lighting a lamp. As
its rays fell upon his features they clearly disclosed
the hateful effects of his debauch, the havoc his ungovernable
paroxysms of violence and passion had
worked upon him. The veins of his forehead were
dark and swollen, his eyes inflamed and hollow, his
look that of a worn-out demon. He was still agitated,
and his blood-shot eyes swept the room fiercely like a
wild beast still unsatisfied. His breathing was labored
and his mood still that of half-suppressed fear
and rage. Frowning and irresolute, he paused after
lighting the lamp, then began to pace the floor unsteadily,
his pace increasing in fretful rapidity as
he continued his short, irregular perambulations. At
last, as if wearying of this, he stopped short and
leaned his weight against the pair of sleeping-bunks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then the indistinct form of a man appeared
noiselessly in the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom eyed it fearfully, while his face grew pale
and moist with perspiration. He clutched at the
sides of the bunks to support his trembling limbs.
Then commanding his courage he demanded somewhat
unsteadily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?—speak out—be you man or devil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer was a wordless mumble. The dim
form slipped forward into the light and the broad
figure and grinning face of Ocpic stood revealed, and
Broom’s courage was greatly restored. He heaved
a long sigh of relief and made a ghastly attempt at
jocularity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you imp of Satan,” he cried, “what do you
want here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ik-ki mai</span>” (It is very cold), declared the Eskimo
with an accompanying expressive shiver. Then,
entirely unsolicited, he lit the fire, which had gone
out during Broom’s absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom paid no further attention to the native.
With short, jerky steps he recommenced his restless
walk, pausing now and again with a nervous start as
the wood in the stove cracked sharply, like so many
reports of a pistol. He was in an impatient fury.
His deliberations were far from pleasant, for he felt
that however much Roy might be inclined to overlook
the offence of breaking into the liquor chest, he
had, by his unpardonable assault upon Kasba, followed
by his brutal attack on David, put himself
outside the pale of forgiveness. He knew by experience
that the trader would show him no mercy for
this second insult to the girl, and he dreaded his
return. Not that he was a coward—in the physical
sense of the word; if corporal punishment could have
atoned for his brutal conduct he would have taken
his punishment—as he then felt—with the utmost
satisfaction. But he recognized that in bringing this
trouble upon himself he had betrayed the trader’s
trust, and this, to his mind, was a far greater offence
than his more criminal actions—even as cheating at
cards or the like ungentlemanly action is popularly
supposed to touch a man’s honor more closely than
the committal of any offence in the criminal calendar.
He paced the floor impatiently, out of humor with
himself and things else, and cursing with bitter oaths
his folly and the circumstances which led to it. Moreover,
the craving for strong drink was again upon
him, lashing him into a fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had just succeeded in working himself into an
ungovernable passion when the kitchen door was
thrown violently open and Sahanderry burst into the
room. The Indian gibbered wildly and seemed about
to precipitate himself upon Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for you do?” he cried excitedly, pausing in
the doorway and spreading out his hands with a
gesture of interrogation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom stopped short in his walk and stared at the
speaker with eyes that darted malignant hate. The
appearance of Sahanderry was as a match to tinder,
and Broom’s look was so venomous that it disconcerted
the Indian and he halted irresolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry’s discomfiture tickled Broom. He
laughed derisively, then abruptly resumed his tramp,
his manner signifying his utter contempt for anything
the enraged Indian might do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incensed by the man’s laughter, and drawing courage
from his outraged feelings, Sahanderry approached
his adversary with menacing gestures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom halted, turned, and awaited his attack with
a provoking smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly springing forward, the Indian seized him
by the hair of his head with both hands, then paused
to allow him to get a grip on his locks in turn—this
being the tribal idea of the proper opening of affairs
of honor, in which each man, having gotten a firm
hold, tries to twist the neck of his antagonist by
screwing his head into a position not in accordance
with nature’s planning. But Broom, after permitting
his opponent to take up the proper attitude, suddenly
discarded all further recognized rules of Chipewyan
combat and struck the vastly astonished Sahanderry
such a violent blow on the chest that had not the
Indian’s fingers been entangled in his adversary’s
hair, it would have felled him to the ground. As it
was he was able to regain his equilibrium in part
before relaxing his hold, and staggering against the
table, he stood for a moment panting and muttering
curses upon the head of the sailor, then slowly,
craftily, he shifted his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, in coming in contact with the table, he had
instinctively put out his hands to break the force of
the collision and had touched an object that stood
thereon, over which his fingers had instantly closed,
and without pausing to consider what the missile
might be or do, he, in great desperation and excitement,
now hurled it with sudden strength, bred of his
vindictive mood, at the head of the offending Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The missile was the bottle stolen from the chest,
and, hurled with all the force of Sahanderry’s arm,
it struck Broom full on the cheek with a cruel thud,
then fell to the ground and broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This unexpected attack found Broom quite unprepared.
He staggered from the force of the blow,
but suddenly straightening himself, laughed discordantly
and pulled a revolver, which he cocked and
levelled at the now shrinking Indian, who, at the
sight of the weapon, dropped to the ground and
vanished under the table, where he lay trembling
and terror-stricken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian’s extreme fear filled Broom with fiendish
glee. In sheer devilment he fired several times—apparently
at haphazard, but with unerring aim, at
various objects in the room. He was undoubtedly a
dead shot, and, taking advantage of his skill, he tortured
the poor distracted wretch until he moaned
again. Fingering the revolver in an apparently careless
fashion, he touched the trigger and the bullet
passed in close proximity to Sahanderry’s body.
Then throwing up the weapon to feign sudden alarm
it went off as if by accident, the bullet grazing the
Indian’s head. Then followed a display of fancy
shooting, till, suddenly tiring of his amusement,
Broom’s mood changed. His face became grim again
and once more he levelled the revolver at the shrinking
figure under the table. The Indian fairly shook
with terror, and the sweat gathered upon his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry felt that his end had come. Broom’s
ghastly face and glistening eyes seemed proof that he
was no longer accountable for his reckless acts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can say your prayers, you hypocritical imp
of Satan, for I’m going to kill you,” hissed the madman.
“In five minutes more you’ll be a dead man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a dead man Sahanderry certainly would have
been if Broom had been less elaborate in his system
of torture. But during his shooting display Roy
Thursby had arrived at the Fort, and hearing the
report of the last shot had cautiously opened the door,
crept noiselessly across the dark kitchen, and reached
the room in time to hear Broom’s murderous threat.
As his eyes took in the scene presented he started and
raised his clenched hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you hell-hound,” continued Broom, “your
time has come. I——” With a deadly intent he
was sighting the weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! You cowardly bully,” cried Roy furiously
from the doorway. “If you wish to fight you can
fight me, but leave that wretched, cowering Indian
alone.” He spoke rapidly but calmly, and his tone
of command had its effect upon Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What devil’s luck brought him here?” Broom
muttered to himself as he unconsciously lowered the
revolver and stood looking at Roy with darkened
brows. But the next moment he laughed recklessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy started at the sound of this discordant
laughter. He eyed Broom questioningly, apprehensively
for some moments. From his strange agitated
manner, the gray pallor of his countenance and the
wild, shifty look in his eyes, Roy knew that he had to
deal with a man who, if not actually insane, or acting
a part, was on the verge of delirium, or could it be
delirium tremens? But whatever the condition or
cause, the man was in a state that might be dangerous
to himself and to others, especially while in the possession
of firearms. Roy resolved to propitiate him
as far as was consistent with getting him under
control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fight you, my English bulldog; why, of course
I’ll fight you,” cried the frenzied man, handling his
revolver in a reckless manner. “But not in the
low-bred manner of your countrymen, if you please.
Hands are weapons for women; we’ll fight like men.”
Again he flourished the dangerous weapon, then playfully
presenting it at Roy, he shut an eye and took
long, deliberate aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader glanced unflinchingly at the extended
revolver. He fully realized that his life depended
upon the whim of a lunatic, and God only knew what
strange fantasy would next flash through Broom’s
crazed brain; but he realized also it was only a bold
presence that would save the situation. He therefore
desisted from drawing his own weapon, and
remained motionless, gazing unswervingly down the
little blue muzzle before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for some moments, then Broom
laughed uncomfortably, and, throwing up the revolver,
he deliberately fired over Roy’s head. The
bullet whistled desperately near his skull, but he
stood immovable. This unperturbed demeanor appeared
to have a quieting effect upon the delirious
Broom, for he presently lowered his weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile a plan had flashed through Roy’s brain.
He would induce Broom to discharge his revolver at
some innocent object till he was assured its chamber
was exhausted; then, with the help of Sahanderry, he
would secure him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But unfortunately for this plan Broom’s thoughts
had returned to the proposed fight. Flourishing his
own weapon recklessly, he called on Roy to “produce
his gun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, my weak-blooded Englishman; surely
you are not afraid,” he jeered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The offensive tone and leering face provoked Roy
almost beyond endurance. But believing the man to
be for the moment little better than a maniac, he controlled
himself, and drawing a revolver, the one he
had displayed to Delgezie in the camp, he deliberately
opened the breech, ostensibly to discover whether it
was in order, but really to gain time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think—,” he was saying in conciliating
tones, when the other broke in with a shout of demoniacal
laughter; then suddenly remembering Sahanderry
his brows clouded again and he muttered
viciously, “but first I’ll settle with this black trash,”
and once more he covered the cowering creature beneath
the table, causing him to shrink still farther
under cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white fury of Broom’s face and his deadly
earnest manner startled Roy anew. He perceived
that he must instantly distract the man’s attention
if he wished to save the Indian’s life, and presenting
his revolver at Broom, he called, in a tone of stern
command:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop your hand or I’ll——.” He spoke no further.
By some unaccountable accident the weapon
was discharged at the moment when Broom’s finger
was actually pressing the trigger of his revolver to
shoot Sahanderry. Hearing the bullet whiz past his
ears and believing that Roy had wilfully shot at him,
he turned with lightning quickness, diverted his aim
and fired, as he thought, in self-defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy staggered, swayed and fell heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing rigidly erect, Broom gazed stupidly at
the still body. His face was livid. His legs trembled
under him. His arm dropped to his side, his hand
still clenching the murderous weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Picking himself from the corner, where he had
hidden when the trader suddenly appeared, Ocpic
now crept cautiously to the side of the prostrate man.
He dropped on one knee and closely scrutinized the
upturned face. Then laughing wildly, he got to his
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>To-koo-kuni! To-koo-kuni!</span>” (He is dead, he
is dead), he gleefully cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of the Eskimo’s voice brought Broom
to himself. With a strong effort he withdrew his eyes
from the senseless figure and gazed about the room
like one suddenly awakened from an unpleasant
dream, in doubt whether the horrible event had really
taken place, or he had been the victim of some
grotesque nightmare. But all doubt as to its reality
ceased when his wandering gaze returned to the outstretched
body of his victim. This ghastly proof was
sufficient to convince him that the crime was no fantasy
of a delirious brain. He sighed heavily. A
slight convulsion passed over his features. Then,
terror taking the form of defiance, he sprang forward
and stood gazing down at Roy’s still figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A nervous grip was laid upon his shoulder and he
swung fiercely round, his frightened gaze meeting the
oblique eyes of the Eskimo, Ocpic, who stood pointing
with extended arm; as Broom’s eyes followed its
direction his attention was drawn once more to
Sahanderry, who by this time was almost dead of
fright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of the shrinking figure he started violently;
the catastrophe had happened so suddenly
and had so confused and stupefied him that all knowledge
of Sahanderry’s presence had been crowded
from his mind. He now recalled it with fiendish
satisfaction. Here was an object on which to vent
his vicious rage, one who—as he wildly imagined—while
under the secure protection of an all-powerful
master had lost no opportunity to insult him covertly.
But things were now changed; the exchange
of shots had removed the protector, Sahanderry was
masterless, and Broom resolved to take speedy and
adequate vengeance. In his mood of ungovernable
recklessness he hesitated no longer at the thought of
crime, but paused to form a plan of torture sufficiently
atrocious, and the vicious books that were his
only reading supplied him with plots innumerable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon a plan suitable for his diabolical purpose
occurred to him. Smiling sardonically he advanced
to the table, and, stooping, caught the half dead
Sahanderry by the heels, and drew him into the
centre of the room, then, snatching a piece of clapmatch
line from Ocpic’s hand, he bound the distressed
Indian in a secure fashion, the Indian making
not the slightest struggle or even a murmur of
dissent. The latter circumstance greatly amused
Broom—a silent Sahanderry was a new experience.
But his mood soon changed. He again eyed the
poor, bound wretch with triumphant malignance,
and, seating himself upon the edge of a bunk, he
began his torture by elaborately unfolding his diabolical
plot to the trembling prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chuckling with fiendish glee he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Sahanderry, my friend, I am about to send
you to your father, the devil, by means entirely
original and devised by your humble servant. By
the means I have in contemplation you will imitate
the great and excellent prophet Elisha, insomuch as
you will quit this world without encumbering the
earth with your carcass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom paused to enjoy the effect of his words.
Sahanderry’s face was livid. His eyes rolled in
their sockets and threatened to start out of his head.
His lips moved convulsively as if he were attempting
to speak, but he was too panic-stricken to articulate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well satisfied, Broom continued: “I shall proceed
to the trading-store and bring hither a keg of gunpowder.
This explosive I shall place close beside
you, so that you may get the full benefit of it. After
extracting the little wooden stopper, or screw, which
confines the dangerous powder to the inside of the
keg, I shall place the end of a lighted candle in the
hole, so that after burning a short time, in order
to allow you to say your prayers, and me an opportunity
to escape, the flame will come in contact with
the powder, and—” Broom illustrated the probable
result with expressive gestures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry groaned, at which Broom burst into
a great fit of laughter. Then, finding the Indian
was incapable of speech, Broom left the room. He
was closely followed by Ocpic, who, anticipating
some developments of a devilish nature, was singularly
happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Broom and his dusky coadjutor had gone,
Sahanderry made superhuman exertions to free himself.
But he had been too well bound by the sailor
to escape, and by no possible effort could he loosen
his bonds, though the line cut deeply into his wrists
in his violent struggles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bekothrie, Bekothrie</span>,” he called hoarsely, in
vain hope that he who had remained undaunted in
so many encounters, who had survived so many dangers,
would now rise up to his assistance. It was
inconceivably strange to him that Roy should lie
there so impassive, should have allowed these things
to happen without remonstrance, for Sahanderry was
wholly unable to comprehend that Roy could be as
readily overcome as any common mortal. But the
lifeless form was still, and Sahanderry’s heart sank
within him and with apprehensions goaded to the
utmost he waited his enemy’s return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minutes of intense silence passed, then came the
sound of deep breathing, and Ocpic staggered into
the room, carrying a heavy keg. He was followed
by Broom, whose white, set face and feverish eyes
showed him still implacable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry moaned in utter despair. There was
a curious grey pallor under his brickdust complexion.
His heart was beating like a drum. He tried to
speak, but his voice failed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom worked with grim expedition and the preliminaries
were soon over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic stood calmly watching events. His eyes
took on a look of puzzled bewilderment as the work
progressed, but when Broom struck a match to light
the candle, Ocpic divined the hellish secret of these
singular preparations. With a startled cry he made
a bolt for the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Broom caught him and unceremoniously
threw him back. “<span class='it'>What-cha-o!</span>” (Wait!), he said
grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a wary eye on the Eskimo, Broom struck
another match and coolly lit the candle, but a draught
caused the flame to burn unsteadily, and perceiving
this was likely to precipitate the explosion Broom
carefully snuffed out the flame with his finger and
thumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t do! Guess we’ll have to shift it over
there,” he said, pointing to a corner of the room and
glancing significantly at his companion; but Ocpic
hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shift it, I tell you!” roared Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though unacquainted with the English language,
Ocpic understood from Broom’s gestures that he was
ordered to move the keg of gunpowder. He tremblingly
approached, and lifting it gingerly, placed
it in the required place, then glanced furtively around
for a speedy chance of escape. But Broom’s bulk
blocked the way. Perceiving Ocpic’s lightning
glance and divining its import, Broom waved him
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand back!” he snapped fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the native retained his position boldly and
scowled threateningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry lay with palpitating heart, watching
the two men, in the desperate hope that a conflict
might ensue. Devotedly he prayed that they might
come to blows, but after moments of agonizing suspense
Ocpic’s eyes dropped before the grim ferocity
of Broom’s look. He fell back reluctantly, scowling
with rage, and muttering darkly to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candle was again lit, and this time the flame
burned steadily. Broom was satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing aside, he allowed Ocpic to rush from the
room, then quietly he walked to the door. Pausing
at the doorway he called jeeringly back:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, friend Sahanderry, a quick and pleasant
journey!” Then with a burst of sardonic laughter:
“I shall now have the charming Kasba all to
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left to himself Sahanderry lay still and lifeless,
for the grim situation had scared him into a condition
near to death. But presently the instinct of
self-preservation awoke within him. Again he made
terrific struggles to loosen his bonds. With frantic
yells he strove to make himself heard, although he
knew there was no likelihood of anyone being nearer
than Delgezie’s hut, and he realized that the sound of
his voice would hardly carry beyond the walls around
him. Yet in his extremity he found it impossible
to keep silent. He persisted in his exertions to free
himself, for the issue at stake was his life. His
bonds cut deeply into his flesh at every movement
and the pain was frightful, but he struggled till he
could struggle no more and fell back exhausted, his
head dropping to the floor with a dull thud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he lay there like a trussed fowl it seemed to
him that never did candle burn so quickly. It
shortened as if by magic. Soon the flame was flickering
over the black powder. Suddenly Sahanderry
lifted his head and listened with all his might. There
was a sound outside. He gave a hoarse cry for help,
then listened again, his heart thumping like a steam-engine.
The sound drew nearer. It was a terrible
moment. He glanced frantically at the fast expiring
candle. Was there yet time? Spending all his
remaining strength in one long-drawn-out cry, he fell
back to listen. He heard footsteps. They came
nearer, they paused, and then slowly went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Delgezie, who had just arrived. He was
alone, Minnihak having left him to visit a trap.
Finding no one on the look-out for him, Kasba not
at hand to take his bedding, the old man became
uneasy; his heart fluttered with vague forebodings.
He took a few steps toward the house, paused undecidedly,
then suddenly changing his mind, returned
to his sled. Hauling off the dogs’ harness with the
ease and dexterity which come with custom, the old
fellow tied it together mechanically. Then he again
approached the house, muttering to himself in his
uneasiness. Suddenly there was a blinding flash, a
fearful report, then—darkness.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>GRUESOME DISCOVERIES.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It will be remembered that Kasba was left fleeing
in panic terror to her father’s hut; while the boy
David, who had been wholly instrumental in effecting
her escape, lay on the snow, beaten senseless by
an infuriated ruffian’s cowardly blows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Kasba was not composed of the stuff that
heroines are made of, and when she found herself
free, her natural impulse was to place as great a
distance between herself and the scene of danger as
she conveniently might. This she contrived to do
with the best possible speed, but once safe in her
father’s hut and the door secured, her thoughts
returned with a shock to David.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was he? Like a flash the remembrance of
the dark object she had left battling with the enraged
man occurred to her. It was, it must have been,
David. He had sacrificed himself to Broom’s fury
that she might escape. Once thoroughly convinced
of this, all fears for herself vanished, terror for the
boy’s safety crowded everything else from her mind.
Emboldened by her love for him, she hastily unfastened
the door and, stepping fearlessly forth, flew back
over the narrow track. Realizing that every moment
was precious, she returned with incredible speed to
the spot she had quitted in such haste. Heavens!
What was that? The man she loathed and dreaded
was gone, but on the snow lay David.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regardless that the brutal ruffian might still be
lurking in the close neighborhood, the girl, uttering
a low cry, rushed to the senseless boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With tender solicitude she bent over him and
raised his head upon her arm. His face was swollen,
bruised, and stained with blood. His eyes were
closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, David, David!” she sobbed piteously, “you
have suffered for my sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her first agony of feelings over, she was
relieved to find that the boy was breathing regularly.
Still the knowledge that he had received this cruel
treatment in order to save her from insult brought
a fresh flood of tears to her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tenderly she bent over him, while from her heart
a low, piteous appeal went up to heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the boy’s eyes unclosed, he gazed around
in a dazed, bewildered fashion, then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened? Where am I?” he asked
wearily, and then: “Ah! I remember, the Ball-eye
(white man),” he added with a quick start of apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he has gone now, dear,” said Kasba. “He
is a bad, wicked man and will be abundantly punished
when Bekothrie returns. Come, dear, you must not
stay here any longer. You will freeze. Let me help
you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David staggered to his feet. Broom’s dastardly
blows had been directed at his upturned face, so
although giddy and faint he was still able to walk.
The pair had not gone far before they heard a voice
hailing them from the rear. Turning, they discovered
Sahanderry striding toward them in vague
alarm. When told of Broom’s offences he was impatient
to find and chastise him, but controlled his
impetuosity till he had seen Kasba and the boy in
safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walking slowly with the assistance of Sahanderry
and Kasba, for he would not hear of being carried,
David was brought to the hut. Then, leaving Kasba
to attend to the wounded boy, Sahanderry rushed in
blind, impetuous haste to the Fort, his whole frame
trembling with passion—and with what result we
already know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With infinite tenderness the girl washed and
dressed David’s bruised face. Then she assisted
the boy to her own bed. He at first strongly objected
to this, but Kasba was obdurate, and with a sigh of
content he at last laid his aching head on the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving him to fall asleep, the girl sank upon a
seat in utter dejection. She remained seated a long
time, fearing to move lest she wake the boy, who had
quickly fallen asleep; then an explosion shook the
little house to its foundations. Kasba started to her
feet and stood petrified with fear. With a heart
beating rapidly she waited and listened, but could
detect no further sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scared cry from the bed brought her to her
senses. She flew to David, whom the noise had
rudely awakened, and throwing her arms protectingly
around him she turned her scared face to the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation was nerve-trying. Except for their
own audible breathing the darkness of the hut was
as silent as the tomb. Clasped in each other’s arms
the two waited tremulously, expectantly, with fearful
apprehensions, but of what they could not know, for
only silence followed, silence becoming painful as it
lengthened into minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Choking down the hysterical sobs which threatened
to overcome her, Kasba gently released herself
from the boy’s embrace. A pale gleam of light
relieved the gloom from pitchy blackness. Moving
cautiously about, she found the lamp and lit it. The
light gave her additional courage. She went to the
window and looked out. All was quiet. The view
was bleak and cold, the dim light outside revealed the
desolate waste but indistinctly; objects took phantom
forms, appearing weird and out of all proportion.
With a shudder of undefined dread, the girl turned
away from the casement and went back to the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David received her with a keenly expectant look.
Kasba shook her head with a wan smile in answer to
his mute inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing, that I can see, dear,” she declared
with relief, sinking on the bed beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it an earthquake or an explosion?” he asked,
in an awed whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An explosion, dear, and at the Fort, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More of that devil’s work, I suppose,” said the
boy after some considerable thought. Then quickly,
“I wonder if Bekothrie was at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl sprang to her feet. The knowledge that
her father and Roy were expected back that evening
had entirely slipped from her mind. She stood
rigidly erect, thinking desperately. What should
she do? Perhaps the trader or her father had been
injured by the explosion, perhaps both. She must
go to the Fort to discover by their living presence
that they were safe. Snatching her coat from where
it hung, she drew it on without further delay or
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy watched her breathlessly, wide-eyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to the Fort, dear,” she said gently but
firmly. “Like a good, brave boy you will stay here.
I shall not be long away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David caught his breath sharply, but smiled back
manfully with a palpable effort to hide his fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without pausing for further speech the girl stepped
into the night, into the solitude and darkness, and
with anxious heart passed swiftly along. Suddenly
there broke forth upon the intense silence a loud,
long-drawn howl. Kasba’s blood ran cold. Again
that dismal howl. From its great resemblance to a
dog’s she knew it for the voice of a wolf, and one
suffering from hunger—its presence so near the Fort
told her that—yet no thought of turning back beset
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Awed and breathless she paused on the overhanging
rocks at the back of the Fort, straining her eyes
to distinguish between the conglomeration of buildings
beneath her, which loomed up indistinctly; but
there was just sufficient light from the stars to enable
her to see that one of them was missing, that Roy’s
dwelling had tumbled down. The space it had occupied
was lumbered with a disorderly pile of logs.
“Good heavens!” came from the girl’s lips—she was
speaking distractedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So intent was she on trying to divine what had
really happened that she shrieked aloud when something
approached and touched her. It was Minnihak,
Roy’s Eskimo guide. Perceiving who it was,
Kasba clutched him excitedly by the arm and eagerly
questioned him as to her father and Roy’s whereabouts.
Failing to make him understand in Chipewyan
she essayed in English, but only to meet with
the like unsatisfactory result; the bewildered native
shook his head, for he was conversant with neither
language. The girl’s feelings on first perceiving the
Eskimo were of surprised relief, but her fears were
instantly goaded to the utmost the moment she found
she was unable to make herself understood. The
suspense was appalling. Conjecturing evils of the
very worst type, the girl was moved by an irresistible
impulse to approach and search the ruins. Neglecting
all precautions, regardless of all peril to herself, she
flew down the uneven track, with an instinct that
was truly marvellous avoiding the boulders and
holes. A few moments and she was beside the mass
of logs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An awful accident must have happened to bring
about the ruinous condition of the trader’s dwelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should she do?” she again asked herself.
“What could she do? Where was her father, where
Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waited and listened. All was still. The situation
for a young, timid girl was extremely nerve-trying.
A short time previously Kasba’s natural
disinclination to scenes of violence would probably
have caused her to rush frantically away and precipitate
herself in her father’s hut to indulge in a fit
of hysterical weeping, but now the uncertainty of
her father’s and Roy’s fate chained her to the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were they? Perhaps beneath those logs!”
The thought was horrible. When contemplating
that huge pile all hope faded from her mind. The
mere possibility of their being in the house when the
explosion took place caused her heart to stand still,
her blood to run cold. For it seemed an impossibility
that they could have escaped being crushed to
death beneath the falling logs, even if they had in
some miraculous manner escaped injury by the explosion.
Perhaps they now lay pinned to the earth,
mangled and bleeding; and struggling with the convulsive
sobs the mere thought called forth, she bent
over the débris. Frantically she strove to push aside
the heavy timbers that she might discover what lay
beneath them, fearing at any moment that her eyes
would meet some ghastly remains of one of the two
men she loved. Yet with unflagging energy she
worked on. In her frantic haste she was dimly conscious
that the Eskimo had followed her, was lifting
and throwing aside the ponderous logs with surprising
energy; evidently he had caught her idea. But
despite the native’s prodigious efforts and her own
desperate exertions the work proceeded at a snail’s
pace. Kasba quickly realized that her own puny
strength availed her nothing, and a despairing moan
at her own impotency escaped her. Her head was
whirling round and round and she felt faint and
giddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that precise moment, as if heaven had pitied
her helplessness and answered her prayer, a slight,
muffled groan smote her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba uttered a cry of joy, for she recognized it
as the sound of a human voice, knew that someone
was alive beneath the ruins. Gathering strength
from hopes renewed, the girl tore more frantically
at the logs, straining every muscle to draw them
aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the voice was heard again. It was
speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly Kasba paused in her panic haste to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Kli-et-ee?</span>” (Who is there?), it said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I, Kasba!” cried the greatly excited girl.
“Who speaks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sahanderry!” returned the voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a cry of disappointment Kasba fell back. In
her anxiety she had quite forgotten Sahanderry. She
had imagined it to be her father who spoke, and her
heart had leaped within her for joy. But now that
she discovered it was not her father but another, the
revulsion of feeling was too much for the already distracted
girl. But the thought came to her that a
life was in deadly peril, that Sahanderry was entombed
in that rude black pile and that immediate
aid was necessary. Chiding herself for the delay
and for her selfish regrets, she worked desperately
to accomplish a rescue. The painfully disappointing
incident, however, had sobered her. She now
worked just as desperately, but with more system
than before. By the aid of the Eskimo she quickly
had a number of logs placed on one side. She then
discovered that the house had not fallen completely,
as she had at first believed, but that the walls farthest
from the seat of the explosion, and a part of the roof
attached, had not come wholly to the ground but
were propped up by the other parts of the fallen
building, forming a sheltering cavity, though threatening
to fall with a crash at any minute. Beneath
this dangerous but friendly shelter the groaning
Sahanderry was discovered lying prone upon the
ground. A timber pressed him to the earth and kept
him from rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Groping in the dark, Kasba and Minnihak ultimately
freed and carried Sahanderry from the ruins,
but with heroic self-denial the girl refrained from
questioning him till a large fire had been made by
setting a light to some of the wreckage. The night
was intensely cold and Sahanderry was chilled to
the bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crouched over the fire, his eyes wild and bewildered
in expression, for he was not yet fully convinced
of his miraculous escape. His burnt and
torn clothing, his scorched hair and eyebrows, testified
to how narrow that escape really had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After waiting some minutes—interminable minutes
they seemed to the girl—she could restrain herself
no longer, but with a voice which quivered with
suppressed but almost overpowering anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Se tah</span> (my father), <span class='it'>Bekothrie</span> (master)?” she
queried desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The injured man staggered to his feet with a
hoarse cry of horrified remembrance. All thought
of Broom’s deadly shot and its consequences had completely
slipped from his confused brain. Released
from a position of extreme peril, saved from what
he had considered an absolutely certain death, his
mind had become blank to all else but his own unaccountable
deliverance. The girl’s questions brought
back all the terrors of those horrible scenes. He
wiped the sweat of remembrance from his brow with
trembling hands. He shook like a leaf in a storm.
Completely overcome, he lost all power of speech and
stood rocking himself to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the horror of conviction that either Roy or her
father, perhaps both, had perished miserably, had
been blown to pieces or scorched out of all semblance
of a human creature, Kasba started impetuously forward.
Clutching the distraught Sahanderry’s hands
she forcibly drew them from his face. “Where are
they?” she demanded sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pointing with a shaking hand at the ruins, “Bekothrie
is there,” he cried hoarsely, then fell upon his
face writhing and groaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ignoring Sahanderry’s emotion the girl rushed
back to the ruins. Quick and agile as a cat, she
sprang from log to log, then suddenly disappeared
altogether. Minnihak, who had remained motionless
beside the fire, watching the foregoing proceedings
with great bewilderment, followed less hastily.
Arriving at the spot where the girl had disappeared
he paused to look about him. A sharp cry, proceeding
from the same pile of logs that had protected
Sahanderry, caught his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Squeezing himself between huge beams which hung
dangerously suspended in his path, Minnihak dimly
discerned Kasba bending over a dark figure. Picking
his way carefully, he approached her, and by the
uncertain light discovered her supporting the head
and shoulders of a man upon her knees. But there
was nothing in dress or figure by which to identify
him. His clothes were burned to rags, his face was
black, and all his hair had been scorched away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet though Minnihak failed to recognize him,
Kasba had; and all in a flutter of tenderness words
of love poured forth thick and fast, but Roy lay all
unconscious, deaf to everything.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV.<br/><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>A BITTER SORROW.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nota Kaholthay, Jesus Christ, Notyanayne
neoltze nogahneayta Tattaahyenay naso noayl nahnathath
doko eethlahse choo. Amen.</span> (The grace of
our Lord, etc.)” The words broke the solemn silence
in the distinct but tremulous voice of a young girl;
a voice trembling with earnestness as the benedictory
blessing passed her lips, every tone filled with suppressed
anguish, revealing the agony of a broken
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene was as solemnly impressive as the words;
two open graves rudely hewn from the hard-frozen
earth—accomplished by infinite labor after burning
fires over the spots for hours—one of them empty
while the other revealed a shapeless, undefinable
bundle in its cold depths. Beside this one stood
three dark muffled figures, sharply outlined against
the perpendicular face of rocks. The central figure,
the speaker, one of the most touching sights on God’s
fair earth—was a girl bowed by a great, an overwhelming
sorrow, a girl in whose eyes dwelt a look
of unutterable despair. This was Kasba; not the
young, lovingly-impulsive girl of yesterday, but a
girl-woman, a woman of steady and implacable purpose,
with feelings so lacerated in the last twenty-four
hours that she had grown numb with pain.
Horror upon horror had fallen upon her until further
grief could no longer be felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On her left was the unmistakable figure of Sahanderry.
He stood rigidly erect with eyes fixed sorrowfully
on the shadowy object at the bottom of the
grave. Tears streamed unchecked down his cheeks
and violent sobs convulsed his frame. Venturing
to raise his eyes at the girl’s concluding words, he
threw her a hasty glance; her unnatural composure
puzzled him. With a pathetically resigned air she
closed the book from which she had been reading,
and slowly advancing to the edge of the grave, stood
silently gazing into it. The despairing agony in
her face was pitiable, for the grave held all that was
mortal of her beloved father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inconceivably strange it is that Delgezie, being on
the outside of the house, should have been killed,
while Sahanderry, who lay close to the seat of the
explosion, had escaped with his life, in fact was
almost uninjured except for being badly scorched and
<a id='thro'></a>thoroughly shaken. It would be hard to explain this,
or any part of the seemingly miraculous events that
followed this disaster. Even the sanest reasoning
would fail to convince. The natural inference was
that the gunpowder-keg had not sufficient resistance
to cause the devastating combustion the incident
would lead one to expect and that Delgezie had been
killed by some flying object hurtled through the air
by the force of the explosion—but this was supposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside the girl, and completely overcome with
grief, was the boy David. He was sobbing audibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stepping back from the grave, Kasba signed to
her companions to fill it in. This was the signal
for Sahanderry to give full vent to his lamentations
while he dropped clods of frozen earth reverently
into the hole. These were instantly followed by the
sound of dull thuds. Kasba started at the gruesome
noise, a startled cry escaped her, but she displayed
no further sign of emotion. Stunned and dazed, she
stood silently watching the work go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task completed, Sahanderry and David, overcoming
their more violent grief, turned to the girl
for orders, but remained discreetly silent. Kasba
was gazing fixedly at the grave as if her eyes could
penetrate the hard, flint-like earth to where the body
of her father lay beneath. Suddenly she tottered
forward and, uttering a low, despairing cry, fell on
her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ay, setah! setah!</span> (Oh, father, father!)” she
moaned, with her face pressed to the icy clods. She
remained in this attitude for some time wrestling
with a feeling of unutterable loneliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her companions scarcely breathed. Presently
she kissed the hard sod, rose quickly and turned
slowly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering the lonely hut she dropped into a seat
and remained in an attitude of deep despondency
with eyes fixed upon the floor. The entrance of her
sorrowing companions passed entirely unnoticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking pains to make no unnecessary noise, Sahanderry
first attended to the fire, then seated himself
in a gloomy corner, and from this vantage-ground
watched the sorrow-stricken girl. David sank on the
floor at Kasba’s feet, crouching with his head pressed
tightly against her knee, and without raising her
eyes the girl dropped her hand upon his head and
let it rest there in sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time dragged on. Deepening shadows crept
across the room, gradually enveloping all objects in
dismal gloom. The solemn ticking of the clock
sounded vastly disproportionate and seemed in the
melancholy silence to vibrate with the hum and noise
of some mighty machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout these dreary hours Kasba sat mute
and desolate, taking no heed of time, battling with a
confused sense of irreparable loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Completely stunned by the succession of terrible
shocks, she had been too bewildered to fully understand
the significance of the solemn service she had
read at the grave-side. The bitter fact that her
father was dead and that she had buried him that
afternoon filled all her mind, and for the first time
in her life her never-failing consolation was denied
her. She could not pray, and she was disconsolate
indeed, for there was no other comfort in earth or
heaven.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But Kasba dare not look heavenward, for bitter,
rebellious thoughts had hardened her heart. What
had she done that this great trouble should be visited
upon her? Delgezie had been both father and
mother to her, soothing and tending and caring for
her in her infantile afflictions with all the tenderness
and affection of a loving mother. From the day of
her birth he had surrounded and guarded her young
life with the wealth and strength of a passionate
love. The deep affection he had borne his poor dead
wife had been transferred to the child she had left
to his care. She became the joy of his life; his one
thought was for her happiness, his one aim her comfort.
They had been all in all to each other, and
that God-fearing man had been cut down in an
instant, without even the mournful consolation of a
parting word. As the knowledge of her loss gained
upon her the loneliness of her position grew correspondingly
distinct. Poor, weary, sorrow-stricken
girl, tired and harassed by her multitudinous duties,
confused from want of rest and sleep, she sat buried
in the perplexities of a series of most singularly
strange and terrible happenings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet she had still another duty to fulfil, another
painful task to perform—a task, if possible, more
keenly agonizing than the burying of her loved
father. In a corner of the room lay the body of
Roy Thursby, the man she had loved with all the
strength of her simple young heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy’s body had been carried to Delgezie’s hut, but
all attempts at resuscitation had proved futile, and
it now lay on Kasba’s bed, covered with a white sheet,
awaiting burial. The body, however, had not yet
been sewn up in canvas, as was customary immediately
after death. This still remained to be done,
although the empty grave beside Delgezie’s yawned
for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently in the gloomy darkness Kasba sat in a
procrastinating mood. The stern burial custom of
her race and a solemn duty to the dead called
urgently to her to complete those last sad rites, but
love with equal persistence implored for longer
respite. Tremulously she shrank from the heart-rending
ordeal of hiding forever the face she loved
so ardently. Yet she well knew the task to be unavoidable,
she would allow no other hand to touch
that dear form, to cover his dear body with the garment
of the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The darkness grew intense. The feeble gleam of
twilight from the window failed to pierce the room’s
pitchy blackness any longer. The noisy clock
ticked on incessantly. Silent and motionless the
three figures sat like three grim statues, so inert were
they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length a weird, ghostly sound broke the deathly
stillness. With one accord Kasba and Sahanderry
started to their feet. They gazed toward each other
with horrified eyes, each striving to pierce the black
pall which hung between them, to discover if either
was the author of the strange sound. David cowered
upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock ticked ominously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two figures stood speechless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again that ghostly sound, and now it was like a
deep, long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously Kasba and Sahanderry darted forward—Kasba
to the bed and Sahanderry to the door,
through which he vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba softly bent over the indistinct figure lying
there. With senses strained to the utmost she
paused, breathlessly listening. Hours might have
passed, or only moments; she could not have told.
Again that deep, sighing sound. It came from beneath
the white sheet upon the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sharp cry Kasba fell upon her knees. With
outstretched hands and upturned eyes, “Almighty
God,” she cried in accents of exceeding joy, “I thank
Thee for this miracle.” Then for the first time
since her father’s death she fell into a storm of
weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figure sighed again and slightly stirred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Springing to her feet Kasba softly uncovered Roy’s
face and then quickly lit the lamp and held it in
her trembling hand. The light fell upon the form
of Roy Thursby. He lay calm and still, and Kasba
waited with bated breath in an agony of suspense,
her heart beating tumultuously. Presently there
was another sigh and Roy’s eyes slowly opened. The
girl started and trembled as he turned his head
toward her, but there was no gleam of recognition
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba stirred uneasily. Her heart beat so for a
moment that it well-nigh choked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slight sound caught his ears. His lips moved—“Who
is there?” The words came slowly; they
were spoken only by great effort and scarcely above
his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Kasba,” said the girl when she could control
her voice sufficiently to speak. “There was an
accident and you were hurt. I—they brought you
to my father’s hut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—are—we—in—darkness?” asked Roy
with infinite labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba stared at him in horrified amazement, for
the light she held fell full upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment an ejaculation from behind caused
her to glance back. In the doorway stood the boy
David with an expression of terrified wonder on his
face, and towering over his shoulder, with his head
pushed well forward, was Sahanderry who stood awestruck.
His mouth was wide open, and his piercing
black eyes, large and round, betrayed the amazement
he felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba beckoned him to come forward, and putting
the boy aside, he cautiously entered. With eyes
intent upon the countenance of his master, Sahanderry
drew near the bed. Then realizing that Roy
was in truth alive, that by some seeming miracle he
had returned from the very brink of the grave, he
sprang impulsively forward, and clutching one of
Roy’s hands, burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bekothrie! Bekothrie! I am glad—me!”
he sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This miraculous escape from the dead was more
in accord with his wonderful faith than that Roy
the all-powerful could be overcome, and his jubilation
knew no bounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Sahanderry,” said Roy, still speaking in a
low, weak voice, “tell me, why are we in the dark?”
There was a slight tone of apprehension in his voice,
as if he divined that some evil was being kept from
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry ceased his sobbing and gazed with perplexity
at Kasba.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—,” he began, but Kasba with a swift gesture
clapped her hand over his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silent as the motion was, the slight, almost imperceptible
sound made by the girl in shifting her position
caught Roy’s attention. He lay with a painfully
strained look upon his face, and in an attitude of
intently listening. No one spoke. The man and girl
watched him with fast beating hearts, a look of horror
growing in their eyes, for a terrible suspicion gradually
took possession of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will—you—not—speak?” he said hoarsely.
“Speak, why—is—there—no—light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry glanced in consternation at his companion.
He moved uneasily. His lips parted as if
in speech, but he answered never a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy waited, breathing quickly. Presently a look
of suspicion passed over his face. “Speak, man, I
command you!” he cried with greater force. “Is
there a light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing a desperate, imploring glance at Kasba,
Sahanderry wrung his hands. “Yes,” he faltered,
“but—,” he stopped suddenly, the unutterable despair
on his master’s face held him tongue-tied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments Roy lay silent, completely
overcome by the sudden, appalling revelation; then,
clutching convulsively at his eyes: “Oh, my God!
my God! I am blind!” he moaned.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>RETRIBUTION.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The first grey streaks of a dawning day crept
stealthily across the horizon, and gaining strength in
their silent progress finally revealed a rough brushwood
camp <a id='ensc'></a>ensconsed in a good-sized bluff of trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The multitudinous tracks and well-trodden snow,
the number of mutilated tree-stumps standing white
and ragged—evidence that a quantity of wood had
been cut quite lately—several large holes, blackened
as by fires, and the general untidy aspect of the whole,
told that the camp had been in use several days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early though the hour, the camp appeared deserted,
but a closer inspection discovered the shadowy
figure of a man seated in a corner of the barricade.
He was muffled in a hairy-coat, with the hood drawn
well over his head, and he sat silent and motionless,
in the position of one wrapt in peaceful slumber, or
absorbed in deep thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were several peculiarities about this camp.
Immediately behind the quiet figure a number of
green spruce trees had been arranged to form an
additional protection against the blast of a biting
wind, while a pile of wood lay inside and close to the
man’s hand. These unusual features spoke strongly
of the presence of an invalid, or one incapacitated in
some manner from moving easily about. There was
one other odd thing, a revolver lay at the man’s right
hand, fully charged and with its butt toward him,
as if for instant use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly the fire burned down, and with the curious,
faltering gesture of one feeling in the dark the man
put out his hand and carefully replenished it, then
again subsided within himself. The new fuel burned
briskly; tiny flames started from the dying embers
and caught desperately at the fresh fuel, and gathering
strength in the consumption thereof they burst
upward with fierce wild roars and lit the camp for
many yards around, revealing the figure and features
of its lonely occupant. It was Roy Thursby. Yet
was it Roy Thursby? It was like him, but with a
look of great misery stamped upon him. His face
was ashy-grey. His eyes seemed fixed upon the leaping
flames, but, alas! he only knew of their close
presence by his acute senses of hearing and feeling,
for he was totally blind. The longing, wistful expression—so
pathetic in the faces of the blind—was
already showing upon his face. He sat with bent
head, leaning slightly forward, musing in mournful
retrospect upon the last few days. They had been to
him nothing but excitement and horror. Truly the
shot that had left him lying senseless, cutting a deep
furrow across his skull and stunning him for many
hours, had saved him the harrowing, blood-curdling,
diabolical details of Broom’s subsequent deeds, but
the fearful discovery his returning consciousness had
revealed was, perhaps, the most terrible a human being
could experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blind! Oh, the misery in that one word! What
desolate loneliness! What unfathomable despair!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy’s passionate prayers to God to release him
from a long, grim night of unlifting darkness were
painful beyond words to those who witnessed them.
It was with feelings of the greatest relief that his
companions finally saw him sink into a state of
apathy. From that hour Roy was as one who has
some awful fear upon him; he started at the slightest
sound. None save himself knew how bitter were his
feelings, how acute his anguish. And always from
his soul this cry went up: “What have I done to
deserve this terrible affliction?” His whole life was
blasted. All his bright dreams, all his ambitions,
were roughly brought to an end, and from a man,
young, strong, resolute, he had become more pitiably
helpless than a little child—all by the evil-doing of a
reckless, useless man-animal to whom he had been
rescuer and friend. Alone, and solely by the strength
of his personality, he had succeeded in a difficult and
dangerous enterprise, and with pardonable pride
awaited his reward and the approbation of a powerful
and generous Company. But now all enterprise, all
ambition, lay dead, and he must spend the rest of his
days away from companionship of his kind. He had
already fought this out with himself. The battle had
been fierce, but short and decisive. His keen appreciation
of what was due to others had won the victory.
Why should he go to the front, return to civilization,
to Lena whom he passionately loved—he, a useless
incumbrance, compelled by the very nature of his
affliction to depend upon others for even the most
trifling offices? Better far that she should believe
that he had met his death in the explosion—Delgezie’s
grave would lend color to that belief—and when the
first bitter sorrow of the blow had worn off she might
still be happy with another. Why then should he
doom her to wear out her life by the side of a hopeless,
melancholy invalid? Besides, he shrank from
exposing his extreme helplessness to other eyes, even
though they were the eyes of a sympathizing friend.
Yes! He would spend the rest of his life in the company
of the faithful Kasba and Sahanderry, at some
camp which they might make in the desolate solitude,
far from all possibility of encounter with any white
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Discovering what she fully believed to be Roy’s
dead body, Kasba had despatched Minnihak with a
message to Acpa, acquainting him with the trader’s
death and requesting him to come and take charge
of Fort Future <span class='it'>pro tem</span>. Therefore Roy had decided
not to remain at the Fort any longer than it
would take to make adequate preparations for a long
trip, but to proceed by easy stages to a place known
to Sahanderry, where a stay might be protracted to
any length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a startling incident had compelled them to fly
Fort Future with scarcely any preparation—Broom
had appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sahanderry and David were away from home and
Kasba was outside gathering an armful of kindling.
Her first intimation of the ruffian’s presence was a
rude arm around her waist, and a voice in her ear,
which said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my bonny Kasba! I’ve come back for
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In utter surprise and consternation the girl gave a
startled cry which rang out sharply, and, caught up
by the echoes, it was thrown on and on till it died
away in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing the cry Roy sprang to his feet within the
house. In the excitement of the moment he forgot
strength and courage could avail him nothing. He
stumbled across the room but could not find the door.
It was in this awful moment that he realized how
utterly helpless he was, how miserably incapable to
protect those in his care—those who, accustomed to a
lifelong protection, were totally unable to think for
themselves in moments of great crisis. Listening
intently he could distinguish a noise made by scuffling
on crisp snow. He knew it was Kasba who cried,
that she was being molested. Oh, for the gift of sight
for one moment! His agony at being unable to render
the girl assistance was so intense that he sobbed
like a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the scuffling ceased. Then there was
another cry and the sound of departing footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stumbling about the room, Roy again made frenzied
efforts to find the door, but struck against something
and fell to the ground. He tore at his eyes,
then, calling loudly upon his Creator, and in sheer
desperation, shouted with the full force of his lungs.
Hearing the voice of a man he verily believed
dead, Broom dropped the girl and staggered back as
if shot. Then with a white, scared face, he dashed
away, as if pursued by some ghostly visitant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had scarcely disappeared before Sahanderry
and David returned. Sahanderry’s great trepidation
at hearing of the adventure plainly told Roy that he
could not be depended upon to protect Kasba, for,
although he was unable to see Sahanderry’s terror,
the Indian’s tremulous voice betrayed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the quick decision of an ever-resourceful
mind, Roy ordered his companions to prepare for a
hasty flight, so that when Broom returned—for Roy
felt that he would return—he might find the girl far
beyond his reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So a few things were gathered quickly together
and packed upon a dog-sled and soon Fort Future was
deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first few days the party travelled incessantly,
only pausing for the scantiest of meals and an
occasional short sleep; but when they arrived at the
spot described at the beginning of this chapter, Roy,
who rode on the sled, discovered that Kasba was
suffering greatly from the hardships of the long and
severe trip; despite her heroic efforts to appear
thoroughly alert and quite rested after each short nap,
she was unable to hide her weariness of voice and
movement from his quick ear, and at the risk of being
overtaken he had ordered a few days’ halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning of which we write, Sahanderry
and David had left the camp early to go some distance
on a hunting expedition, for the food supply
was getting low. Kasba had wandered into the bush
and Roy was left alone with his bitterness of spirit.
To have run away from Broom, to have deserted his
post, was gall to his soul. With an ejaculation he
flung more wood on the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a slight girlish figure crept cautiously
to where he sat and stealthily reached for the revolver.
Grasping the barrel, she was drawing it
gently toward her when a hand descended heavily
upon hers and held it in a vice-like grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that?” demanded Roy, turning his sightless
eyes upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stifled a scream. Roy’s sudden action
had surprised and greatly startled her. “It is
Kasba,” she said, almost crying with vexation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why do you steal into camp in this manner?”
asked Roy sternly. The girl’s peculiar behavior had
made him apprehensive of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'> After hesitating a moment Kasba uttered the one
word—“Broom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy’s face hardened, his whole body stiffened
ominously, for he conjectured that his enemy was in
close proximity. “The villain!” he muttered. Then,
releasing the girl’s hand, he held out his own and demanded
that the revolver be put in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reluctantly Kasba complied with his demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, “Where is he?” enquired Roy in a low,
tense voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At some distance. He is with the Eskimo Ocpic,
in camp and asleep. I discovered them and came
back for the revolver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I might kill him,” hissed the girl, with
flashing eyes and her bosom heaving with uncontrollable
excitement. Then, “Oh, give me the revolver,
Bekothrie, and let me go,” she pleaded; for
her bitter hatred toward her persecutor had completely
overcome the terror she had always felt for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! That is my work,” said Roy sternly. “Lead
me to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl had been taught strict obedience, and did
not pause to argue with Roy as to the improbability
of his being able while laboring under his terrible
affliction to accomplish his revenge by shooting
Broom. Besides she, like Sahanderry, had a deep-set
belief in Roy’s infallibility. With hasty fingers she
fastened on his snowshoes. Then, taking his hand,
she gently led him forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The way was rough and tortuous. With her disengaged
hand and her strong body the girl forced a
path through the bushes so that none might touch
him in passing. Their progress was necessarily slow
and laborious, their footsteps uncertain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time, which seemed interminable to Roy,
Kasba halted. They had arrived at a poorly constructed
camp. Two figures muffled in <span class='it'>kaip-puks</span> lay
side by side within it. Over the feet of one a rough
pilot-coat had been thrown. Kasba had come across
the camp, and recognizing the coat as belonging to
Broom, divined that he lay beneath it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are there, Bekothrie,” said Kasba softly.
Despite her efforts to control it, excitement had unstrung
her nerves and thrown a quiver into her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Point the revolver,” commanded Roy, fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba hesitated. What if it was not Broom after
all, but some innocent person? But only a second
did she falter, for the remembrance of Broom’s diabolical
doings caused implacable wrath to surge
within her. Cautiously she led Roy forward a few
more steps, then halted and with a steady hand
pointed the extended revolver at the sleeper’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy stiffened his arm and slipped a finger on the
trigger. He did not hesitate to kill Broom while he
slept. Broom’s crimes had been too heinous to permit
of mercy. A grim look came into Roy’s face; his
finger was pressing the trigger with fearful intent,
when the bright face of a young girl flashed before
his mind’s eye and in his imagination a clear voice
repeated the word’s of Lena’s letter in his ear: “<span class='it'>For
in my opinion it is murder for a man to take another’s
life, no matter what the circumstances that seem to
extenuate it.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to Kasba’s surprise, instead of firing, he
dropped his hand to his side, letting the weapon fall
to the ground. “I cannot do it!” he cried hoarsely.
“Take me away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stared at him, vastly amazed at this sudden,
inexplicable change from grim determination
to profound helplessness. Then obediently she caught
his hand and led him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had scarcely turned before the figure sprang
to its feet. It was Broom! His eyes rolled in his
head and he trembled like an aspen leaf. With a
ghastly white face he stood staring after them as they
slowly retraced their steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared, motionless in his astonishment, for he
had awakened just in time to hear Roy’s words, and
the revolver lying half buried in the snow was all
that was necessary to explain that his life had been
spared. Then, too, he was overpowered at the sight
of Roy’s affliction. Just how he became aware of
this it is hard to determine—perhaps from Roy’s
words, “Take me away,” or his faltering footsteps,
or the sight of the girl leading him by the hand; perhaps
the three combined. However, the sight of the
once active Roy moving slowly, laboriously away
overwhelmed him with remorse. In a flash the heinousness
of his acts came home to him. Sinking upon
his knees in the snow he hid his face in his hands,
rocking himself and groaning like one demented,
taking no heed of time, nor that his hands were exposed
to the bitter cold wind. When at last he rose
to his feet he staggered like a drunken man; the
strength dependent upon his feverish excitement of
the last few days had suddenly left him, leaving him
as weak as one just recovered from a long and severe
illness. He had paid a terrible toll for his mad fits
of passion; his eyes were sunken, his cheekbones protruded.
Scarcely ever sleeping or eating, his thoughts
had been concentrated on possessing the girl. Overcome
with baffled fury at discovering her gone from
the Fort, he had travelled hot-foot in pursuit, but
now that she was within his reach, now that he had
discovered Roy powerless to protect her, his feelings
underwent a sudden revulsion. The spark of humanity
that had long lain dormant under all his
recklessness burned bright at the sight of Roy’s
pathetic figure, and all idea of further pursuit faded
from his mind as completely as if it had never filled
it. In its stead a raging desire to go far away from
the man he had injured possessed him. His mad
desire to possess Kasba, to secure the witnesses of his
diabolical acts, and by some measures not quite plain
to him to prevent them from bringing him to account,
were forgotten in his anxiety, which in the weak
state of mind rapidly developed into monomania—to
place a great distance between himself and them.
And the dogged, mad glare of a set purpose was in his
eyes as with a savage kick he awoke his companion,
crying: “Get up, you black devil, we are going
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic grumblingly crawled from beneath his
blankets, rose sullenly to his feet, and stood staring
inquiringly at his companion. Shifting his gaze, he
caught sight of the fresh tracks in the snow, noted
that they led to and from their camp, and discovered
the revolver. For a moment he stood stupidly looking,
his eyes protruding as if he could scarcely believe
his senses, then slowly he went and picked it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a yell and a spring Broom was upon him,
wresting the weapon away. Ocpic scowled, but retired
before Broom’s look of fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get to —— out of this!” cried Broom, with a
flourish of the revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight smattering of English and Broom’s gestures
sufficiently enlightened Ocpic. They were to
turn back. He stood thunderstruck. To stop the
pursuit meant starvation, for they had no food nor
any ammunition with which to provide food. In
their impetuous pursuit they had travelled night and
day, throwing themselves down to snatch a few hours’
sleep only when they could go no farther. Once
they had been awakened by an explosion. They had
neglected to push the burning embers back from the
camp before retiring and the fire had caught the
brush; spreading to the place where their food and
ammunition had been carelessly thrown, it had burned
up the food and set off the gunpowder. From that
time they had lived on a few handfuls of pemmican
which had been accidentally left in a bag outside, and
thus escaped the fire. But the last of this had been
consumed for their scanty supper and they were now
without a crumb to make breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With pantomimic gestures and broken English
Ocpic tried to make his companion understand that
to turn back would be madness, that only their catching
up to Roy’s party would save them. They had
food, perhaps more than they needed; at any rate he
and Broom could take what they had, and he glanced
significantly at the revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Broom would have none of it. In his changed
mood he would protect Roy, and with his life if need
be. He stood, for the moment, a man transformed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an uneasy pause, while Ocpic cudgeled
his crafty brain: What to do? To him Broom’s
sudden reversion of tactics was a bewildering puzzle.
What had happened while he slept? Ocpic would
have given worlds to know. That someone had visited
the camp the freshly made tracks and the presence of
the strange revolver gave convincing proof. But who?
And why had they gone away? There could be no
one in those parts but the trader and his party, or
perhaps a wandering gang of Eskimos. But a man
of Ocpic’s malignant nature could not conceive of
Roy as visiting the camp and leaving it without so
much as laying a disturbing finger upon the men who
had brought such disaster upon himself and his companions.
Yet it could not have been Eskimos, for
they did not carry revolvers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic’s cogitations were brought sharply to an end
by Broom, who presented the revolver at his head.
“Get out of this, I tell you,” he shouted. Surely he
was going mad, for to turn back was an act of madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still there was the vague chance of meeting with
wandering Eskimos who would assist them with food,
and small though the chance at that time of the year,
it was infinitely better to take it than refuse and
meet certain death. So argued Ocpic. He had once
witnessed Broom’s exploits with the revolver and had
great respect for his markmanship. He possessed a
vivid remembrance of the incident which had caused
Roy to drop like a log.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sullenly Ocpic faced about and with head down
started to retrace his steps of the day before. Broom
followed closely, driving the Eskimo before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus hours passed. Crunch, crunch, crunch,
crunch, the creak of their snowshoes was as regular
as the ticking of a clock, cutting off the yards of endless
track as a clock ticks off the moments of the hour.
Hunger gnawed at Ocpic’s vitals. He was ravenously
hungry and fit to drop with fatigue, but the
stern, relentless hand clutching the revolver waved
him on, ever on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the noon-hour Broom called a halt and the
Eskimo dropped in his tracks and sat on his haunches,
taking the greatest degree of rest out of the short
respite. Broom leaned against a fallen tree; he was
breathing hard and appeared much distressed. The
Eskimo’s glittering eyes took in the situation. The
white man was tiring. Good!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch—soon they were
off again. Nothing but dogged grit upheld Broom.
Crunch, crunch, Ocpic trudged steadily on, craftily
saving himself against the time when his companion
would become spent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the day passed and the gloom of an approaching
night gathered around them. In a subconscious way
Broom was aware that he was starving, that he was
suffering from extreme fatigue, but an indomitable
will and a mortal fear drove him on despite his
physical sufferings. In his frenzied brain there was
but one idea. The Eskimo had evil designs on Roy
Thursby, therefore he must drive him away. His
own vile part in what had gone before was completely
forgotten—all knowledge of the past was swallowed
up in the vital present. In his changed mood Roy
was a hero, a martyr, a man to be worshipped, protected,
saved at all costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch; the night fell and
the moon rose gloriously, shedding a pale blue light
over the silent white world in which these two plodding
figures seemed to be the only things possessed of
animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch. Perceptibly
Broom’s strength was waning. He began to stumble
over nothing, to draw his breath in broken gasps.
The incessant crunch, crunch of his snowshoes beat
on his brain like a hammer. The earth heaved and
rocked, his legs dragged heavily, he staggered in his
gait. At last he fell, but soon by sheer effort of will
struggled to his feet. Ocpic, plodding in front, noted
the circumstance with a triumphant smile. He did
not turn his head, continuing his mechanical walking
as if nothing had happened. But imperceptibly he
quickened his stride. With ears strained to the utmost
he took cognizance of his companion’s rapidly
failing strength, and slowly widened the distance between
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crunch, crunch, Ocpic was rapidly drawing away.
Confident in his ability to escape, he chuckled
silently. But he was not quite easy in his mind, the
revolver still causing him a little apprehension. However
he was almost out of range; a few more steps
and, presuming on his companion’s preoccupation,
he lengthened the gap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly it dawned upon Broom that Ocpic was getting
farther and farther distant. Suddenly he
divined the cause—Ocpic was running away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a cry of mad rage he started in pursuit, calling
loudly to him to stop. Ocpic stopped, hesitated,
then started off again. Broom followed, rocking from
side to side as he ran. He fell—got up—ran a few
yards, then stumbled and fell again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a loud curse he struggled to his feet for the
last time; he was beaten in the race but not yet
foiled in his purpose. Concentrating his remaining
strength he drew himself erect, took deliberate aim
and fired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic uttered a wild yell, staggered on for a few
more steps, and then pitched forward. Simultaneously
with the pistol’s report Broom collapsed and fell.
The last spark of his vitality had flickered out. Two
huddled forms lay prone upon the snow, and for a
little time all about was still and silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length Ocpic straightened himself out and tried
to rise, but fell back, groaning. Again and again he
tried, and with each attempt a dark blot widened
upon the snow. Not to be outdone, he began to crawl
toward Broom. Slowly, painfully, a few feet at the
time, he crept along, and a thin dark line following
in his wake discolored the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom sighed and opened his eyes. The red glare
was gone. He lay quite still; the long trail was at
an end and he needed rest and food—yes, possibly
food. But for the time being he was almost comfortable.
He was conscious of stabbing pains in his ears,
and that his face and hands were rapidly becoming
stiff, but what was that? The time was past when
small things mattered. He was very comfortable—and—Ocpic
was creeping nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never in his life had Broom felt so happy. A
heavy burden seemed to have dropped from his
shoulders. He felt as light as a feather. In sheer
ecstasy and with a long sigh of contentment he closed
his eyes—Ocpic was quite close!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom’s mind now began to wander. He murmured
to himself, living over again events in his
chequered career. Then a restful look came on his
face and he babbled of boyhood days; of days—long,
long ago—before he had grown into a hardened reprobate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Ocpic was at his side! And drawing a
knife!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom! Broom! Awake! Open your eyes, for an
assassin lurks near!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom smiled and spoke softly a woman’s name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raising himself on one elbow Ocpic bent over him!
Something glittered in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opening his eyes, Broom smiled up into the little
rat-like orbs above him, which darted back malignant
hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, with a fleeting return of consciousness,
he recognized Ocpic. He gazed perplexedly into the
malevolent face of the little Eskimo, and then he
remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocpic upraised the knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broom chuckled. “Well, you damned Husky!”
he said, “So I did for you all right, eh? Come now,
give me my quietus and I’ll race you into hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as if Ocpic accepted the challenge, the knife
descended.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>The silence of the grave lay over the white world.
There on the snow, almost side by side, lay two lifeless
figures with distorted faces and eyes that stared
at the stars. In the far distance was an indefinable
object moving. Slowly, stealthily it approached. It
was an animal. Pausing, the creature threw back
its head and howled. Soon other dark objects appeared.
They were wolves assembling for the feast.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>A NARROW ESCAPE.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>If Roy had not been with them, the Indians would
certainly never have found themselves in such a desperate
plight. They would never have thought of
attempting to cross the river, for they understood
better than anyone the portentous signs of a “break-up.”
But Roy in a black humor had decided to go
on, and his word was law. Therefore, what else
could they do? What was left them to do? They
would as soon have thought of questioning the wisdom
of the Creator as disputing Roy’s judgment—probably
sooner. For such was their habit of obedience,
a habit handed down by generations of men who
had been Company’s servants. In truth Sahanderry
had turned positively grey with terror when Roy
had decided to cross. However, though he was not
one of the bravest of men, what he did was not easy.
It required considerable self-control to lead the way,
as was his duty, for it was like walking to almost
certain death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since leaving the spot where they had as they
thought left Broom asleep, the difficulties of their
journey had grown with every passing day; indeed,
the last few days’ travel, toiling ankle-deep in slush,
had been very hard work, for spring had come upon
them and the snow was disappearing as if by magic,
and though they had not many miles to go, the nearer
they approached their destination the slower had
been their progress, and this had irritated Roy almost
to a frenzy. Consequently the signs that should have
warned him to stay had been the very things to urge
him on. Clearly his usual good judgment had been
at fault; and his blindness could not have been wholly
responsible for this, as his hearing had been preternaturally
sharpened thereby and there could have
been no possible doubt as to his having heard the
frequent significant explosions up the river, which
had been loud enough to waken the dead, so to speak.
Moreover he had had a good idea of the character of
the river, therefore these recurring reports should
have been sufficient to warn him. But truth to tell
his mood had become fierce and reckless, and brooked
no control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Howbeit the little party found themselves on a
surface of quaking, rocking ice that threatened to
“break up” and move out at any moment. Just
where they were the river was of considerable width
and the ice was very soft, and they were in a very bad
way indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rain had fallen during the past week; floods of
the creeks and larger tributaries were pouring into
the river, and the great volume of water was lifting
the ice, and, as it strained and labored from this
great pressure, the explosions grew louder, nearer and
more frequent. Presently, far up the stream, a huge
billow of straining, tumbling ice-cakes reared its head
and came steadily toward them. Behind this mighty
billow was the spring freshet against which nothing
could stand. Meanwhile, his eyes wide with terror,
Sahanderry slipped and stumbled ahead of the poor
miserable dogs, who strained and tore at their traces,
half running, half swimming in places, where the
water was deep. The sled and everything on it were
streaming wet, for at times it was almost entirely
submerged in deep holes, filled with water. The
dogs were urged on by the boy David, who, though
almost played out by dragging the sled, still “drove
them up” vigorously; turning ever and anon to look
back at Kasba, who was following slowly, painfully,
behind, and leading Roy by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By and by there was a ruder shock than any that
had gone before and the whole ice field became in
motion. Startled at last out of his indifference, Roy
gave an exclamation of concern and stood still, but
his expression did not change; he was perfectly cool
and self-possessed; the sort of coolness that comes
upon strong men in moments of danger. The grinding
of the ice was terrible to hear, and soon the whole
ice field was moving down stream. Roy, now thoroughly
alive to their situation, turned to Kasba:
“The river is ‘going out’?” he said, interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl paused to control her voice before she
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bekothrie,” she said quite steadily. “It
is on the move.” She neither wept nor trembled,
though she fully realized the danger they were in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we return to the bank?” asked Roy quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked back. The ice behind them was
piling along the shore in impassable confusion. “No,
Bekothrie,” she said, “we cannot go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the others?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far in front,” answered the girl. “They are
waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then send them on,” said Roy peremptorily.
“Let them save themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon Kasba waved Sahanderry and David
on. The man at once struck off, but the boy paused
as if loath to go. At that the girl frantically repeated
her gesticulations and the boy drove up his dogs
again, but with apparent reluctance. Soon man, boy
and dogs were lost to sight in the confusion of ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are gone, Bekothrie,” affirmed the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Roy, “let us go too.” The girl
took his hand again, and they went on their way.
Their progress was necessarily slow. Their path was
strewn with pitfalls for Roy’s feet, and soon the girl
was panting from her exertions in keeping him upright,
but within her delicate body there dwelt an
unconquerable spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching a comparatively smooth surface they
skated along with increased speed. There were
puddles of water which they could not avoid. Cracks
more or less wide open barred their way, and guided
by the girl Roy crossed them, jumping easily or
exerting himself to the utmost, according to the
emergency. But more than one opening was too
wide to allow of any assistance from Kasba’s helping
hand, and he had to make the attempt entirely by
her direction. All this was very wearying, for however
careful he might be, he was bound to expend a
great deal of strength to no purpose. It is one thing
to jump with eye and muscle acting together, and
another to do it blindly, as everybody knows. Poor
Roy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At times there were gaps which neither could leap.
They skirted these, walking as fast as possible. Out
of breath and entirely worn out with fatigue, Roy
would often fall in a heap upon the ice to rest. He
was cold and disheartened, and would have given up
altogether if it had not been for the girl’s presence,
for he valued his life not a jot since his terrible
affliction. Therefore his own danger appealed less to
him than the girl’s situation. It seemed such a
terrible thing that she should lose her bright young
life in trying to save his, which was worthless. He
well knew that by herself the girl could have crossed
the river safely, for she was fearless and as agile as
a cat, springing and climbing with the greatest ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the ice started to rock beneath their feet.
“Hurry—hurry!” cried Kasba, dragging him forward
with the desperate energy of a man. “We have
not a moment to lose if we would save our lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me,” said Roy withdrawing his hand, “and
save yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the girl gazed at him in horrified
surprise. “Leave you!” she exclaimed in a tone that
was unmistakable. “I will not leave you.” There
was a power in her tone that struck him with amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I keep you back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, I will not leave you,” repeated the
girl firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of their desperate situation Roy could not
help smiling. He realized that their positions had
suddenly changed; it was the girl’s spirit which now
predominated. “Very well, then,” he said, giving
her his hand again. “Go on.” The thundering of
the broken ice floes, the grinding of the smaller pieces
against each other, made conversation difficult. Here
and there the force of the flood piled up mountains of
cakes which, after a moment, toppled over with a
deafening crash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently there was a shock which capped all
others, and the ice field stopped. They knew that
somewhere below it had become jammed, and that an
added peril threatened them, for the river was rising
each moment, and if the ice did not overwhelm them
it seemed that the flood must. The cakes rocked
threateningly, collided together, then stopped, but
the jam could not hold them back long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stumbling, struggling, striving, Kasba dragged Roy
along. They were pitiful sights, these two. Their
hands and feet were bleeding, their moccasins had
long since worn out, as had the duffles and hose beneath
them, and their clothes were cut and torn.
Kasba’s dress hung in ribbons and was soaking wet,
impeding her movements, while Roy’s knees showed
through great holes, the result of many tumbles.
Every step he took was an effort, a terrible effort, still
he dare not give up and let the girl die, for she would
not leave him, he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slipping and sliding they struggled on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, to Kasba’s horror, they came to a strait
of dark water at least five feet across, while on either
hand huge piles of ice cakes blocked their way. The
situation was desperate. The girl stopped dead,
holding Roy back. “We cannot go on,” she said.
“We have come to a very wide crack.” Then she
laughed as lightly as if there were no such thing as
danger. Roy heard her and understood; she was
pretending to be gay in order to make it easier for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wide is it?” he demanded, steadying his
voice with difficulty. The situation was very nerve-racking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very wide,” returned the girl. “The widest
yet. You must not attempt it; you will fall in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not,” replied Roy with emphasis. “Can you
manage it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bekothrie,” declared the girl bravely, her
voice quite unshaken. Then she laughed again in the
same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, jump it, then,” said Roy, “and I will
follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl hesitated a second, then with a coolness
that was wonderful she sprang across, but it took
all her agility to clear the gap. With a white, set
face she stood looking anxiously back at him, across
the deep, dark water. “Turn a little to the left,
Bekothrie,” she directed. “That will do. Now advance
a few steps. Stop! You are now on the edge.
Spring straight forward and I will catch you.” The
girl braced her feet to receive the shock, while poor,
blind Roy bunched his muscles for the effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” shouted the girl and stood with hands
extended ready to receive him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the word Roy launched himself forward, but
at the same instant the ice rocked beneath his feet
and almost threw him down; recovering himself
somewhat, he made his spring, but it fell short and
he plunged into the water. Kasba uttered a cry of
horror and despair, but stooping till she was herself
in peril of falling she grabbed him by the collar with
both hands and held him up. It was a terrible
moment. The girl skilfully shifted her clutch to
Roy’s wrists, first to one hand, then the other, grasping
them with a hold like steel; then, bracing her
feet with a strength inconceivable in so frail a body,
a strength far beyond her years and size, she lifted
him so high that he could relieve her of his weight
by sprawling on his chest across the ice and by
wriggling his body assist her to haul him out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Roy staggered to his feet with an unsteady
laugh, but the girl, who stood breathing hard from
the efforts of her superhuman exertions, looked
anxiously into his face and saw that his teeth were
chattering and that his lips were blue. He was
shivering from head to foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are cold,” she said, greatly alarmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not,” denied Roy shortly, but for the life of
him he could not keep his voice steady. “Come, let
us get on,” and unaided he tottered forward a few
steps, then swayed and would have fallen had not the
girl supported him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must rest,” she said decisively, studying his
face closely. “Sit down.” Taking his arm, she
guided him to a nearby hummock. “Sit down,” she
repeated; “the ice is jammed and for the moment
we are safe.” She tried to speak cheerfully, but
Roy’s desperate case made her sick at heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a wonder Roy obeyed, though to be strictly
truthful he could not do otherwise. His brain was
beginning to reel from exhaustion, and he fell rather
than sat down. Every bone and muscle ached; his
breath came in gasps. The girl seated herself beside
him, and quite unconsciously his head dropped back
and rested against her shoulder. She took one of his
hands softly in both hers while she gazed into his face.
She loved him more than her own life. Poor little
thing, how her heart fluttered, how the blood rushed
to her face! She drew him closer and covered him
as much as she could with her arms, trying to put
some warmth into his icy-cold body. She was afraid
that he would hear her heart, which was beating like
a hammer. She was for the moment indescribably
happy. Careless of any danger to herself, she looked
up into his face as he leaned against her and held
him tighter. There was not a trace of fear in her
own face, nor indeed of any feeling but love and
sympathy. If they were to die, she would prefer to
die like that. What did anything matter since they
were together?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy seemed to divine her thoughts. “What’s the
use of your remaining?” he asked. “You cannot
save me by losing your life.” He spoke almost
roughly and the girl started as if struck a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not frightened,” she answered quietly. “It
will not be hard to die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy turned half round, as if to look into her face;
in fact, his sightless eyes seemed to be fixed upon
hers. “You are a very brave girl, Kasba,” he said
tenderly; “the bravest I have ever known. Why are
you so good to me?” The words were scarcely spoken
before he regretted them; a distressed look came to
his face instantly, for he remembered and was deeply
touched by the sincerity of her love for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl said nothing for a moment, but looked at
him with a smile of unutterable tenderness, which
he could not see. “I love you!” she said simply.
“Now you really know, at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew already,” declared Roy. His voice rang
painfully, for he understood how she loved him as
he had not understood before, and it seemed as though
it must have somehow been his fault. The full
strength and nobility and devotion of her passion for
him rushed on him. For the first time he saw the
splendid heroism of which her untrained nature
would have been capable had she met with a different
fate, and it filled him with a passion of remorse.
“Poor child! poor child! What have I done to be
worthy of such love?” he murmured, and feeling for
her hand, he found and pressed it, almost caressingly.
Then, drawing her to him, he felt for her
face, and, taking it between his hands, he drew it
closer and kissed her smooth young forehead. “Poor
child,” he repeated sadly. There was a shadow of
pain in the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyes filled and she uttered something
that sounded like a sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant there was a tremendous explosion
below, and soon the ice field started to move again
down the current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl started up, and seizing Roy’s hand she
pulled him to his feet. “On! on!” she urged. “We
must not stop here. The jam has burst and we shall
be carried out to sea.” As the field moved, mountains
of ice which had piled up because of the jam, toppled
over with deafening noise, and for a time no other
sound could be heard. Guiding Roy, the girl moved
forward as swiftly as possible. The fates were good
to them. Before them, and reaching almost to the
opposite shore, was one vast stretch of smooth ice.
Once upon that they made better progress and Kasba
grew hopeful. Moving their feet as if skating, they
rapidly drew nearer to the shore. Soon Kasba was
able to make out the figures of Sahanderry and the
boy David, who stood in perilous positions on top of
huge blocks of ice, which the action of the flood had
piled up on the shore during the jam. They were
waving frantically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are almost there,” Kasba shouted encouragingly
in Roy’s ear: “We shall be saved yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roy shook his head. He could not understand
the words addressed him. Nevertheless he did his
best to keep up as the girl dragged him forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were now close, but the ice they were on was
fast going down stream, and the two on the ice wall
were compelled to scramble along in order to keep
abreast. Presently there was a lull in the noise
caused by the grinding, screaming ice and they could
plainly hear Sahanderry’s voice adjuring them to
hasten. Roy raised his voice in a mighty shout in
reply, using his fists for a trumpet, and tried to increase
his pace, but stumbled at almost every step.
However, the girl was possessed of marvellous
strength and dragged him by sheer force toward the
shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And soon they were at the base of the ice wall,
which they were passing at a great rate. Sahanderry
on the summit above them whirled a coil about his
head, then throwing it away from him, it straightened
itself out and an end fell at Kasba’s feet. It was the
clapmatch line which belonged to the sled. Quickly
the girl caught up the end and tied it round Roy’s
waist. But, divining her intention, he caught hold
of her and despite her struggles would not let her go.
The boy and man began to pull upon the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foundations of the ice wall were being undermined
by the rushing water and it swayed threateningly.
Would it hold a little longer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man and boy strained on the line, and half-climbing,
half-scrambling, the two were dragged together
to the top of first one ice block, then another.
They were now out of danger from the ice floes, but
the structure they were on was trembling and threatening
to collapse, and desperately they strove to gain
the summit before it should topple upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving the danger, Sahanderry and the boy
David tugged on the line with every ounce of their
strength, and Roy, who clung with a deadly grasp to
the girl, was pulled violently to the top, and as he
came the girl was dragged up with him. Once there
the whole party lost no time in precipitating themselves
down on the other side, and before long were
safe ashore, nor were they a moment too soon; for
they had scarcely left the ice before the entire wall
swayed slowly over and toppled into the river with
a thundering crash that sent a painful thrill through
each one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God we are saved!” cried the girl breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” said Sahanderry solemnly, lifting his
hat and reverently bowing his head, an action which
was closely imitated by David. Roy nodded, but
said nothing. He was too exhausted for words and
was again shivering violently. Kasba silently pointed
this out to Sahanderry, who at once turned his attention
to building a shelter in the form of a brushwood
camp, while David made a huge fire, which was no
sooner lighted than Roy threw himself down beside
it, and almost immediately clouds of steam rose from
his wet clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they were all enjoying the warmth of the
blaze. They had not eaten since early morning, but
after such a day of fatigue and excitement they all
felt more inclined for rest than food. On comparing
notes it was found that, except for an overpowering
fatigue, a severe wetting and minor cuts and bruises,
none of them were any the worse for their nerve-racking
adventure. But they would not go on farther
that day—that was of course out of the question.
Later in the evening Roy decided to spend a few
days on the spot, and in the end determined on remaining
there altogether. For he thought the situation
over carefully, and decided that with the break-up
of the river spring had come in earnest. Nature
was awaking once more from her heavy sleep in the
long winter night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The renovation of creation in spring is, I think,
more impressive in the Far North than in any other
part of the world, on account of the greater contrast
with what has gone before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This river, Roy argued, would serve their purpose
as well as the one they had had in mind on leaving
Fort Future. So Sahanderry was told to make a
house in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite their desperate situation Roy could not
help smiling when he gave the order, for there was
practically no building material at hand. Nevertheless
Sahanderry soon accomplished his task. The
walls were of small logs, the roof of several layers of
parchments (undressed deerskins), which they had
brought with them, stretched to the tightness of a
drumhead and overlaid with turf. A hole cut in one
of the walls was, in the absence of glass, covered with
a piece of cotton and formed a window. The door
was made of boards which had been chopped with
infinite labor from logs. There was no chimney, nor
was it required, as, in the absence of a stove, the
cooking would have to be done outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in this primitive dwelling Roy Thursby decided
to drag out his monotonous existence.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>AN INGENIOUS EXPEDIENT.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>One morning a few weeks later the sun rose
quickly over the horizon, as if it had overslept and
was hurrying to make up lost time. Its angry crimson
face threw a lurid glow across the sky, like the
reflection of some mighty conflagration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small coast-boat, dancing on the waves of a flood-tide,
tugged impatiently at her anchor, while a strong
south wind sportively dashed an occasional drenching
spray across her deck, much to the discomfort of a
number of men lying there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length one of these recumbent figures rose slowly
to his feet and scanned the horizon with a sailor’s eye.
It was our old friend George Hopkins. He stood for
a moment staring at the crimson sunrise, then touched
the nearest sleeper with his foot. “<span class='it'>At-tee, Oulybuck,
A-no-ee pi-chi-ak</span> (Now, Oulybuck, it is a fair
wind),” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo addressed threw back his blankets
with a sleepy ejaculation, rose to his knees and then
to his feet, gazing around him the while. When his
eye encountered the threatening sky he uttered a disapproving
grunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One by one four other Eskimos crawled from under
their blankets, yawned, stretched themselves, and
scowled at the approaching storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes the little anchor was up and the
boat was speeding on her way north. Hopkins
perched himself in the stern to steer while the Eskimos
dropped into positions of ease, awaiting orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the wind freshened and the sea began to
dance. As the boat cut her way through the billows
a head was poked out from an improvised cabin amidships.
It was the head of a man well on in years,
with grey hair and a long grey beard. His keen blue
eyes scanned the heavens, noted the direction of the
wind, then turned to the steersman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair wind, eh! George?” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopkins glanced at the lowering clouds, then with
dubious cheerfulness, he replied: “Yes, but we’ll
have bad weather before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hope you are mistaken,” returned the
other, withdrawing his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes he reappeared fully attired. It
was Chief Factor McLeod, accompanied by his
daughter Lena and his nephew Frank, and on his way
to inspect Fort Future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after Mr. McLeod’s appearance the sound
of girlish laughter, mingled with the protesting voice
of a man, proceeded from the cabin. There was the
noise of a scuffle, then a young woman burst out and
sprang behind the Factor. As she stood there, her
face alive with mischievous laughter, her eyes sparkling
with merriment, her bosom heaving with the
exertions of her playful struggle, she was the picture
of a bonny, saucy, Scottish maiden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon a fresh, boyish face appeared in the cabin
doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Uncle,” groveled the young fellow, a
little sulkily, “I wish you would keep that daughter
of yours in order. She is more mischievous than a
monkey. Yes, a monkey, miss,” he added severely,
for the girl was making grimaces at him from behind
her father’s back. “She can’t leave me alone five
minutes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lena! Lena!” admonished Mr. McLeod with a
smile and a look of deep affection. “Will you never
act as a grown-up young lady should?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed derisively at her cousin, then,
abruptly turning her back, she caught her father’s
arm and pulled him to the side of the boat. As they
gazed over the turbulent waters, a low, hoarse roar
made itself heard above the noise of dashing waves.
The expected gale was upon them. A damp column
of cold air struck the boat, bellying out the canvas
with a jerk, and wrenching the yielding mass, until it
bowed heavily over before the shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mainsail was quickly dropped and the boat
righted herself. Sluggishly great waves buffeted her,
causing her to stagger when they struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the gale became furious, fully justifying
Hopkins’ prognostications. The sea was so rough
that the boat was in great danger of being smashed
by the sheer weight of water hurled against her side.
But they were compelled to go on, however terrible
the storm might be, for the wind had swerved round
to the west and this, with the tide on the ebb, prevented
them running close-in to anchor in one of the
numerous rivers along the coast. The boat was fast
being carried out to sea, the land was becoming a
thin black line in the far distance, and shortly all
trace of it was lost to sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving their peril, Hopkins gave the helm to
a trusty lieutenant and stumbled forward to speak to
the Chief Factor, who was standing there alone. He
had long since sent Lena to the cabin and now stood
with his arm twined around a back-stay, strung to the
tension of a harpstring, and his eyes sparkling with
excitement as the little craft beneath him tossed and
rolled and tore along. His drenched hair and beard
were flying back from his face, which was streaming
with salt water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s not holding her own against the combined
fury of wind and tide,” he cried at Hopkins’
approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re being carried out to sea, sir,” declared
George with some disgust. Just then a tremendous
sea caught the boat and she gave a lurch, throwing
him violently down. The plunging masses of water
made her quiver to her keel, and threatened to
swamp her, but digging her nose into the great waves
she staggered on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God we are still afloat,” murmured Mr.
McLeod. “Another shock like that and it will be
all up with us.” Then turning to Hopkins he
enquired whether he had been hurt in the fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopkins shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are being carried out to sea, you say, but
what can we do?” questioned the Factor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can drop anchor, and try to ride it out, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Factor shook his head. “The seas would
smash us,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George nodded. “Then we must hoist the mainsail
again. I’m afraid she won’t carry it, but we can
try. There’s a shoal that runs from a point of land
ahead of us; if we can make that we’ll anchor in the
lee of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right! Hoist your mainsail, then. But have
it close reefed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Staggering back to the stern, Hopkins resumed
charge of the rudder and the mainsail was reefed
and hoisted, but with great difficulty, for the wind,
catching the spreading canvas, flapped it with a
report like a gun-shot, threatening to snatch it away.
The extra sail caused the boat to heel over alarmingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smothered ejaculation of concern came from the
cabin and soon Lena appeared, enveloped in a serviceable
macintosh. Perceiving that she was alone the
Factor hastened to assist her to a position of safety.
Meanwhile Hopkins was straining his eyes in search
of land. He was feeling very uneasy, for it seemed
impossible that the boat could much longer resist
the perpetual attack of the waves. The point at
issue was simply—would the coast-boat last till they
reached a place where they could anchor, or would
she be swamped or smashed to pieces before they
reached a place of safety?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length there was a shout from an Eskimo lookout
in the bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nuna!</span> (land)” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ninne? Ninne?</span> (where? where?)” asked the
other Eskimos in chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Na-nee!</span> (there)” cried the bowsman, pointing
almost straight ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” exclaimed Mr. McLeod, with a
long sigh of relief, while Hopkins’ face cleared, and
the Eskimos lost their anxious looks, for right ahead
of them was a small island of sand, over which the
waves broke in rapid succession. It was the shoal of
which Hopkins had spoken, and for which they had
been so anxiously looking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their jubilation was shortlived, however, for they
had scarcely got the anchor ready before the boat
struck something under water with a terrible thud
and remained fast. The jerk caused by the sudden
stoppage threw the men off their feet, and snapped
the mainmast short at the shaft, carrying the sail
and gear overboard. The boat heeled over, great
waves dashed into her and in an instant she was full
of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick of action, the Chief Factor caught Lena
about the waist and hoisted her to the top of the
cabin, then, scrambling up himself, he signaled to
the others to do likewise. The roaring of the surf,
breaking over the small island, drowned all other
noises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to Hopkins and forming a trumpet with
his hands, the Factor endeavored to make himself
heard. “Tide’s going out,” he shouted. “Shoal
will dry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may walk ashore .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if boat will
only last till then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopkins’ lips moved in answer but his words were
carried away by the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two hours the group crouched miserably upon
the cabin, clutching at anything within reach to save
being washed away by the great volumes of water
that poured over them. Lashed by the wind, and
drenched to the skin, they waited for the tide to ebb
and leave the boat high and dry upon the shoal. The
tempest continued with unabated fury, but the little
island grew larger every minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually the billows receded from the boat. They
then discovered that Hopkins had run her on a part
of a shoal which extended to a great distance under
water at high tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the shipwrecked party were able to drop
over the boat’s side to the sand beneath, and walk
to the prominence of the sandy island, where for a
time, at least, they would be safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calling Hopkins aside, the Factor attempted to
prepare for eventualities. But it was only by turning
their backs to the wind that they were able to
distinguish what was said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hopkins,” Mr. McLeod began, “it is necessary
that we should discover if there is any means of
leaving this shoal before the tide turns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” replied George, “and the sooner the
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it will necessitate an exploration of that
part of the shoal,” said the Chief Factor, indicating
the part nearest the mainland, “and that is still
under water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ready, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, George, I know you are always ready to
do your duty, but you cannot go alone. We will go
together. I must see for myself. My nephew and
daughter will remain with the Eskimos. You will
tell the Eskimos to stay near them till we return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopkins instructed the Eskimos who straightway
grouped themselves near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mr. McLeod was informing Lena of
the proposed reconnaissance. Embracing her father,
the girl urged him not to risk himself unnecessarily.
The Factor promised to be as prudent as possible,
then called Hopkins and they set out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with the greatest difficulty that they faced
the wind, but struggling desperately and unceasingly,
they crept along. After an extremely difficult and
laborious journey they arrived at the other end of
the island, or shoal, and to their dismay found it was
divided from the mainland by a large bay of water,
which the wind was lashing into furious waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking off his <a id='assump'></a>l’Assumption belt and tying a stone
in one end of it, Hopkins lowered it into the water
to ascertain the depth, but was unable to touch
bottom. At this, his face lengthened and the Factor,
who had been closely watching him, gave a groan of
dismay, for their hopes of escape by wading ashore
were destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but a raft can save us now,” said George
dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other shook his head dubiously. He was
turning his footsteps sorrowfully backwards when a
great shout from his companion brought him to a
halt. Turning quickly, he discovered Hopkins
wildly gesticulating toward a point of land in the far
distance, and looking in that direction, he first saw
something infinitely small dancing upon the waters,
then several small objects which speedily followed it.
He turned to his companion for information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eskimos,” explained Hopkins in answer to the
other’s look of puzzled enquiry. “They’ve lashed
their <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span> (parchment canoes) together and are
coming to help us. See,” he added excitedly, pointing
to the far-off land, “they’re camped over there to
hunt <span class='it'>nitchuk</span> (seal).”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Factor turned his eyes to the spot indicated
by his companion and after close scrutiny made out
several tiny white objects dotted about the sand—these
were tents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chief Factor McLeod had witnessed many daring
feats, but never one to compare with this which the
Eskimos were attempting. The waves dashed threateningly
over the <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span>, but seemed powerless to
harm the fragile crafts, which floated with the buoyancy
of cork. At times waves larger than their
fellows caught them, and, carrying them up on their
towering crests appeared to capsize them, but a few
strokes of the <span class='it'>pou-tik</span> (paddle) seemed to right them
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Eskimos drew nearer, the Factor could see
how skillful they really were, with what wonderful
precision they handled the <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span>, which, in this
instance were lashed together in threes, and any
doubts he might have had about their effecting a
rescue by this ingenious expedient were immediately
dispelled. Turning, he gave a joyful shout, which,
carried along on the wind, was plainly heard by the
anxiously waiting party at the other end of the
island. These instantly started to come to him.
The Eskimos staggered on sturdily, but Lena found
it difficult to force herself forward against the
tempest; the wind caught her garments and pressed
her backwards, threatening to throw her off her feet.
It was only by desperately clinging to her cousin’s
arm that she was able to keep her balance and walk
slowly on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving her predicament the Factor went to
the rescue, and with the wind at his back he scudded
along and was soon by her side. He managed, by
shouting his loudest, to make her hear the broken
sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eskimos .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. encamped .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neck of
land .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. coming .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
rescue us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time they had reached the further end of
the island, the <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span> were lying high and dry upon
the sand and the Eskimo strangers grouped together
waiting to greet them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With quaint gestures, the Factor endeavored to
thank them for coming to the rescue of himself and
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intrepid Eskimos received phlegmatically the
earnest expressions of gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They nodded deliberately, glanced at the ebbing
tide, then walked to the <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span> where they stood
significantly waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Divining from their behavior that they were
anxious to start before the tide turned, which, flowing
against the wind would make a rougher and
angrier sea than ever, Mr. McLeod lost no more time,
but straightway led Lena to the <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span>. A trio were
now put on the water and Lena was lifted into the
middle one. Then an Eskimo stepped quickly into
each of the outside <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span> and a start was made for
the shore. The Factor watched the men paddle
desperately for a few moments, then walked quickly
to where a set of <span class='it'>ka-yaks</span> was waiting for him. And
in a very little while the whole number of frail craft
were on the water, battling against wind and waves,
which had providentially lessened in violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an hour or so of arduous paddling the <span class='it'>ka-yak</span>
containing Lena touched the shore and the girl was
lifted unceremoniously in a pair of malodorous arms
and carried to dry land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then at intervals others of the shipwrecked crew
arrived, all very wet, very cold, and very stiff from
sitting in such cramped positions, and painfully they
walked up to a large fire which the Eskimo women
had kindled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After such strenuous efforts, the thoughts of the
Eskimo rescuers turned to a meal, and taking their
shipwrecked comrades with them, they strolled to
where several large kettles hung suspended over as
many fires. Then the men seated themselves in a
circle, the women arranging themselves in another at
some little distance from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two large, oblong, wooden dishes, one for each
group, were brought from the fires and their contents
emptied upon the ground. This was the signal for
a mad rush. The men displayed remarkable agility
as they scrambled with hearty laughter for the sickly
mess—boiled seal meat—while screams from the
group of women told that excitement was likewise
rife in their midst. Procuring as much as they
could hold in both hands, they retired to their former
positions in the circle and with the aid of long,
murderous-looking knives, wolfishly devoured their
portions—cramming their mouths to the utmost extent
and cutting off the remainder uncomfortably
close to their flat noses and chins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all the solids had disappeared, liquids were
brought on. Large kettles containing the water in
which the meat had been boiled were carried into
the centre of the two groups, which once more
became struggling masses of humanity, all of them
endeavoring to dip a can or a mug into the kettles
at one and the same time. The uproar gradually
subsided as each person retired to his or her place,
chuckling over a mug of greasy liquid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This simple but animated repast at an end, the
Eskimos settled themselves for a deliberate smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the wants of the Chief Factor and
party had been cared for by the resourceful Hopkins,
and they were glad to be able, at least for a little
time, to rest and be thankful. But their respite was
of short duration. Fate had chosen that, at that
time and place, they should learn of the awful
catastrophe at Fort Future and the harrowing news
was travelling fast toward them in the person of
Acpa, who was on his way with a party of Eskimos
in a whaleboat to take charge of the ruins of the
Company’s property at Fort Future in compliance
with Kasba’s request, and was on the lookout for
a suitable spot to put ashore and camp. Perceiving
Eskimo tents dotted along the point of land, those
in the boat quickly dropped the sail and pulled to
the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s Acpa!” declared George Hopkins,
greatly astonished, as the old Eskimo stepped out of
the boat. “Wonder what he’s doing here,” and with
that he strolled down to greet the old fellow, little
dreaming what terrible news he would bring back.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX.<br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>KASBA’S SACRIFICE.</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Roy Thursby dragged out a miserable
existence in the little hut on the bank of the river.
Day by day his frame of mind grew more and more
despondent and morbid. Everything worth while
seemed at an end. Except that at certain times there
was the sound of his companions’ movements, and at
others only a dreadful stillness for long days together,
all “Time” was alike to him; to-day the same as
yesterday and to-morrow but a repetition of to-day.
He was merely a machine, going through the daily
routine of getting up and lying down, eating and
drinking, with automatic precision, and the outgoings
and incomings of the male members of his party
marked the period for each of these acts. It was one
long, dreary monotony. He had long since lost count
of the days. He was conscious that the occupations
of his companions varied as the season wore on and
that, in consequence, his diet changed from venison
to fish, varied with the flesh of migratory birds, but
this interested him not at all. He had long lost all
pleasure in food—just eating and drinking to keep
the machine going, that was all. A pathetic indifference
to everything possessed him. He sat for hours
without uttering a word, and when he spoke it was
always in monosyllables, and an awed, unnatural
silence lay over the house from morn till night, for,
as if by tacit consent, the three Indians carried their
conversation to the outside of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus weeks passed. Sahanderry and David
hunted or fished and did the heavier chores. Kasba
dressed and smoked deerskins to make into moccasins,
made and mended the clothes of herself and companions,
cooked the meals and attended to a hundred
and one other things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day the girl brought Roy his dinner as usual.
It was a piece of salmon, the first they had caught.
Setting the plate before him, she retired to a seat and
took up a garment which required mending. Slowly,
and with the indifference of a man without an
appetite Roy lifted the food to his mouth, turned it on
his tongue, sat a moment as if struck by a sudden
thought, and then got unsteadily to his feet, dropping
the fork as he arose. He stood a moment like one
suddenly awakened from a deep sleep, then: “This
is salmon,” he said with a slight inflection as of
interest in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of his words Kasba started forward,
letting the garment fall to the ground. Her lips
were parted, her eyes sparkled. This sudden
interest might portend a break-up in Roy’s apathy,
and to the girl it was as the clear sunshine after days
of dismal gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bekothrie,” she answered as soon as
emotion would permit her to speak. “We caught
the first yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then this is the middle of July,” he said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the girl, divining the trend of his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy breathed hard and his lips moved; but he
dropped slowly back to his seat without further
speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stood with parted lips watching him expectantly,
then, finding he had nothing more to say,
and that he seemed fully occupied with his thoughts,
she breathed a little disappointed sigh, took up the
dropped garment and went patiently on with her
sewing. The stitch, stitch of her needle and the
song of the busy mosquitoes were the only sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that time Roy was as one laboring under
some suppressed excitement, uneasy, as if waiting
for something to happen and dreading while desiring
it. He became restless and impatient to a large
degree and as Kasba went quietly about her household
affairs, she frequently paused to blink away
salt tears, called to her eyes by the sight of his misery.
The once hulking big fellow was but the shadow of
his former self. Great rings showed round his eyes,
his face was becoming more and more haggard and
drawn, his cheekbones protruded sharply. Perceiving
that he was rapidly becoming ill and divining
the cause, she timidly essayed a proposal. She would
go back to Fort Future and by secretly watching discover
when <span class='it'>Bekothrie nithee</span> (the far-away master,
in this case Mr. McLeod), came. But Roy would
not hear of this, though as the time for Mr. McLeod’s
arrival at Fort Future drew near he could scarcely
contain himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fancied the scene; the dismantled Fort, the
grey-haired Chief Factor sorrowfully supporting
Lena, sobbing out her heart over what she believed
to be his grave. He could hear her heart-breaking
cries as she bewailed his loss; hear the cold, tense
voice of the Chief Factor swearing to be avenged on
the perpetrator of the outrage and murder. Then
Lena would be led on board and the boat would sail
away. That would be the end. His mind would
dwell upon this till his brain reeled, and he would
put his hot hand up to his burning forehead as if to
press back his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one day by a process akin to telepathy he
became aware that Lena was near. It was the very
day Mr. McLeod’s boat was wrecked and its occupants
rescued by the Eskimos, and it happened
that they were landed near where Roy had, as he
thought, so securely hidden himself from all communication
with his own kind. At first the poor
fellow believed that his mind must be wandering.
But the conviction that Lena was there, close at
hand, grew stronger every minute, and at last he
could contain himself no longer. He felt he must
send to the coast to ascertain if anyone had lately
landed, or he would go mad. Unwilling to trust the
garrulous Sahanderry, he must perforce send Kasba.
The girl was outside attending to the fire, he could
hear her talking to David. He called to her, and
almost instantly she was at his side, and in a few
words he explained what he wanted her to do. She
smiled confidently. “Yes, Bekothrie,” she said
quietly, and without another word she made her preparation
and at once started off for the coast, which
was about a mile distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arriving at her destination, she discovered the
shipwrecked voyagers. From Roy’s description she
at once recognized them. The Factor was standing
apart with Lena and her cousin. Overcome with
feelings of bitter jealousy, she ventured dangerously
near in order that she might better discern the
features of her fortunate rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grim expression of the Factor’s countenance
bore token of a severe determination of mind. Bitter
sorrow for the tragic end of his promising, inordinately
ambitious young friend mingled with the wrath
he felt toward the perpetrator of the tragedy. He
gazed with loving solicitude upon Lena, who sat in
an attitude of great sorrow. The news had been a
great shock to her. The bright, sunny expression
had entirely disappeared and a pained, startled expression
had come into her face. Her lips trembled
as her father’s hand fell lightly upon her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be brave, my little girl, for my sake,” he pleaded
brokenly. Then he walked to where Acpa was sitting,
surrounded by a number of Eskimos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone with his cousin, Frank was in a
dilemma; he knew not what to say. Lena’s uncontrollable
grief was extremely painful to witness, for
he loved her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he leaned over and gazed into the tear-stained
features, “Lena, my darling,” he said, “do
not grieve so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a strange pleading in his manly voice.
“It breaks my heart to see your distress. After all,
it may be, it must be, some mistake. We shall yet
find Roy Thursby and find him alive and well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is kind of you to say so, Frank,” said the girl
in a mournfully sweet voice, “but there is no hope,
can be no hope, for poor Roy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear Lena,” began Frank, then glancing
behind him, “I heard something moving,” he added,
partly to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Kasba. Attracted by the sight of Lena’s
grief she had drawn quite close. Crouched down
among the rocks she had heard, and the poor girl’s
despair made Kasba’s warm, affectionate heart ache.
The sorrow she herself had suffered, was still suffering,
made her tenderly solicitous for another’s misery.
She stood with hands tightly clenched, battling with
her own desires. She dreaded to speak, to tell Lena
that her lover lived, for she well knew what the result
would be. Yet she longed to comfort her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conflict raged fiercely. The issue at stake
was all heaven and earth to her, for without Roy life
would be blank indeed. Then why should she give
him up? Then she remembered Roy’s misery, that
in his heart he was pining for the companionship of
his own kind, and the inborn truth, the native generosity
and candor, that always overruled every other
element in her, conquered now. Girding herself to
make a great sacrifice, she stepped into the open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bekothrie nithee!</span>” she cried in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. McLeod turned sharply. Lena sprang to her
feet expectant of she knew not what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, nerving herself, Kasba spoke the words
which would make her forever desolate: “Mr.
Thursby is alive,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a cry of joy Lena ran swiftly to the brave
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she asked with feverish
eagerness, holding the girl by the wrist. “Roy not
dead?” Her voice broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, God performed a miracle for me.” The
girl spoke simply, fully believing what she said.
“Mr. Thursby was dead for many hours,” she explained,
“then he came to himself. But he is—”
Kasba hesitated, fearing to speak the terrible truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lena noticed the girl’s hesitation and was alarmed
at once. “Go on,” she cried, clutching the girl’s
wrist hard. “Tell me, tell me quickly! Something
has happened?” Her voice expressed the utmost
anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is totally blind,” said Kasba sadly. She
spoke in the greatest distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lena’s face grew dead-white, she stood stiff and
rigid, staring at the girl, quite dazed at the horror
of the thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blind!” cried the Chief Factor who had come up.
“How terribly horrible! Poor Roy! Ah!” He was
just in time to catch his daughter, who uttered a short
unnatural sound and reeled against him. But she
did not lose consciousness and in a moment her
strength returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go!” she cried, sobbing wildly and
struggling in her father’s arms. “Let me go to him,
or I shall die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall go, my child,” said the Chief Factor
soothingly. He glanced at Kasba, who nodded and
stretched out her hand, that tiny brown hand, which
small though it was, had pulled Roy out of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” she said simply, “I will take you to
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arriving at the hut Kasba stood aside to let Lena
pass. “You will find him in there,” she said. But
Lena did not hear her, for she was already through
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the door opened Roy started upright in an
instant, conscious of the girl’s presence in the room.
Lena’s eyes opened wide with horror at the sight
of him, she started and drew slightly back, struck
speechless by the fearful change in the splendidly
vital figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a painful silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy stood with head thrust slightly forward in an
attitude of listening intently,—in that attitude of
concentrated expectancy of sounds peculiar to the
totally blind; holding his breath to catch the slightest
sound. He trembled all over with excitement.
“Lena!” he cried, in a low, tense voice, though believing
it impossible that she should be there. Then
he swayed unsteadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lena came forward to him quickly, and with a little
cry, in which there was more of anguish than joy, her
arms went about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kasba had remained outside, but she could hear
their voices and for a moment her heart stopped
beating and her lips set tightly. She pressed one
hand to her bosom, uttering a stifled wail like a
wounded animal. The sacrifice had been great. She
reeled and almost fell. Then she made a great effort,
straightened herself and went and leaned against
the hut, on the other side, away from the door, and
covered her face with her hands. Then a feeling of
utter loneliness fell upon her. She felt that something
had been taken from her and given to another—something
that was more to her than life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could still hear their voices. They were
happy together; while she was outside alone. And
so it would always be now. They would take Roy
away and leave her behind, and she would see him
no more. Then she heard footfalls, and one was
Sahanderry’s. He came and stood beside her. She
could hear his sharp breathing. Then, in an impulse,
she dropped her hands and gave them to him.
“He is happy now,” she said, a little bitterly. “Take
me. It was my father’s wish. I am yours.”</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>Here ends the story of Kasba, and the chronicler
makes apology for all that has been amiss in the
telling of the events recorded, conscious that a better
man could have done it better. Whether Kasba will
ever come into another story the author himself
cannot tell, nor does he know whether she will be
welcome if she comes.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
